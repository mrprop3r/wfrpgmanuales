To find out, Kassel will hire folk less likely to raise suspicion than himself to investigate the travelling show. And if Mutants are found, Kassel intends to use the intelligence to blackmail Malthusius into joining his cause as one of the Silver Spires, a secretive cult dedicated to Tzeentch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Key Scene: The Runaway Goblin</h4>\n<p>The Characters’ attention is drawn by the swelling crowds of excited onlookers, and the thunderous tones of the show-owner who is busily drumming up a crowd.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Roll up, roll up,’ he cries, ‘ln just one hour you will witness the most original and astounding display of zoological curiosities ever placed on exhibition in the entire length and breadth of our glorious Empire!’</p>\n<p>‘Welcome to Doctor Malthusius’s Zoocopeia!

A strange creature that appears to be a small, three-legged @Actor[ofriuk4J7tV25DRG]{Goblin} peers out of a cage. It is huddled miserably in a corner, arms folded, tethered to a stake by a chain attached to an iron collar. While @Actor[kQyaJB0lSLQ2NLu8]{Doctor Malthusius} is gathering his grinning crowd, Grunni skulks around the cages, preparing for the show to begin. The Goblin, upon seeing the approaching Dwarf, panics, and yanks hard at the iron collar about its neck, desperate to get away. And then the collar snaps…</p>\n<p>Having broken the poorly forged iron collar, the skinny Goblin squeezes through the bars of its cage, and is off. As the crowd gasps and screams, the panicking creature runs straight at the Characters, who may make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Melee (Brawling)</strong> Test to catch it. If the Goblin evades the Characters, it is captured by other members of the crowd.</p>\n<p>In either case, Doctor Malthusius is extremely grateful for the help in recovering his exhibit, and gives each Character (plus any members of the crowd who assisted) @Credit[1ss EACH]{1 shilling} each, inviting all to watch his show for free. </p>\n<p>Once everyone is calmed, Grunni starts takes the @Pay[1ss]{1-shilling} entry fee as he lets the excited folk into the roped ring. Once everyone is in, Doctor Malthusius checks the crowd for Witch Hunters. Once happy, he takes centre stage as Grunni brings forth various oddities and curiosities for his audience to view. He shows an array of extraordinary creatures, including ‘<em>the Horrendously Hairy Horror of Hochland</em>!’ (a long-haired ape bought in Marienburg), ‘<em>the Dastardly One-eyed Dog of Diesdorf</em>!’ (an actual Mutant with a single eye in its forehead, and quite illegal), ‘<em>the Immeasurable Maw of the Middle Mountains’</em> (a relatively small Squig), and ‘<em>the Ghastly Three-Legged Goblin of the Grissenwald</em>!’</p>\n<p>As Grunni leads the Goblin out, it suddenly turns, bites his hand, and makes another break for freedom. The crowd panics, getting in the way and effectively preventing any Character from pursuing the Goblin before it vanishes into a small hole in the town wall behind Malthusius where an iron grating has rusted away to nothing. The Characters have no realistic chance of preventing this escape.</p>\n<p>Soon, a @Actor[nCzNGuS22drsDAIe]{Watch patrol} of State Soldiers arrives to determine the cause of the disturbance. By the time it arrives, Grunni has already returned most of Mathusius’s exhibits to their cages; besides the Goblin, of course. If the Characters don’t volunteer what happened, Malthusius steps forward and theatrically explains the most recent events, carefully avoiding any  mention of the Goblin being a Mutant. ‘<em>Of course, my exhibits sometimes get out of hand. But we are very careful that all our displays are completely legal. ‘Tis naught more than a Goblin, fine sirs!’</em> If the Characters mention the extra leg, the soldiers frown, and Malthusius grins as innocently as he possibly can.</p>\n<p>Realising that it’s more than they can handle, the soldiers soon escort Doctor Malthusius, Grunni, and the Characters to the @JournalEntry[kahbAL4tUYjxkbCp]{Festival Court}, where Magistrate @Actor[P3HlNMK6rubzDoxM]{Heinz Richter} hears their reports. Doctor Malthusius immediately offers the Characters a reward of @Credit[5gc SPLIT]{5 crowns} for the safe return of the Goblin, saying that he is ‘<em>a concerned member of the citizenship, and it is important I play my part in securing this menace!</em>’ Richter nods, impressed with such civic talk, and also offers the Characters the same amount from the town’s purse for clearing the Goblin out of the sewers. He also adds, if the Characters captured the Goblin once before, that ‘<em>Since you have caught it previously, it should not be too onerous a task.</em>’  By the time the case has been heard, and a course of action has been decided upon, it is nearly dark and the fair will be closing for the night.

Its thick air is alive with the sounds and smells of thousands of beasts and their busy handlers. It consists of two wide auction rings for larger animals, dozens of secondary rings for smaller and more specialist animals, and an uncounted number of well-guarded livestock pens. All farm animals are available, but sheep, cattle, horses, pigs, and poultry are most common, with donkeys, cats, dogs, and occasionally rarer creatures also on offer.</p>\n<p>On the first two days, the auction rings host the Grand Parade, where animals are trooped out by the owners to be judged. The best animals win ribbons for ‘Champions’ (best animal of each sex within a breed), ‘Primes’ (best example of a breed), ‘Prizes’ (best example of each animal), and the ‘King’ and ‘Queen’ (best animal of each sex). Possibly for historic reasons, most Kings and Queens of Schaffenfest are sheep. Having an animal win a ribbon can change a farmer’s fortunes, for prize animals earn many times their standard price when sold. Because of this, the competition is fierce.</p>\n<p>At midnight on day two, as gathered merchants hold their breath in anticipation and tax inspectors look on with arms folded, loud bells ring and ‘Geltgrubetag’ begins with a roar of bids and counterbids. For the next 24 hours, all livestock sales are tax-free. Folk travel far to benefit from this unique offer, which only applies to domesticated stock physically in the market. In recent years, the day of frenzied commerce has become somewhat of a spectator sport, with folk gathering to watch traders do everything they can to push as many sales through as possible, ferrying animals at speed as the Duke of Saponatheim’s agents ensure all trades are conducted legally.</p>\n<p>The auction rings are bustling on all three days as stock is brought from the pens and paraded round under the farmers’ and buyers’ critical eyes. But they are always busiest on Geltgrubestag when the stock is actually sold.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An almighty screech pierces the air from the livestock market, followed by a terrible racket as disturbed animals panic in their pens and worried farmers flee.

{"_id":"3eKYpGCvUVuC8YFQ","name":"Weissbruck (EiS)","content":"<p>@JournalEntry[J5MwoouO8HVJgU5h]{Weissbruck} is a swiftly growing town on the @JournalEntry[2fe0ux3fDMtoiHZK]{River Bögen}. It is ruled by the recently ennobled House Gruber, a family that may be rich because of its deep mines in @JournalEntry[DFehHz5QvjtxLsZI]{The Skaag Hills}, but has little in the way of status. Less than a century ago, Wiessbruck was just another small farming and fishing village, but with the opening of the nearby mines and the construction of the canal it has expanded rapidly. </p>\n<p>It is now a bustling merchant town, and the sound of construction rings everywhere as new buildings expand the outskirts to all sides. Warehouses line the canal and river banks, storing coal and iron ore from the nearby mines, wool and wine from @JournalEntry[Bögenhafen]{Bögenhafen}, and all manner of goods from Altdorf, Carroburg, and @JournalEntry[852goA3i0uEOwFeY]{The Vorbergland Canals}.</p>\n<p>Since the <em>Berebeli’s </em>toll was paid at the Altdorf side, the barge is waved through the final lock by the lock keepers, and turns upstream on the River Bögen. There are a number of barges tied alongside the wharf, and shipping can be seen moving up and down the river. Several inns look out on to the river and the canal.</p>\n<p>It is likely to be early evening by the time the Characters arrive. As they prepare to tie up their barge, they can’t help notice a shadowy, travel-stained character standing in the doorway of the Black Gold, a nearby inn. This is @Actor[echM0Sjy5xpt5KAQ]{Adolphus Kuftsos} the bounty hunter. He watched the <em>Berebeli </em>enter the Weissbruck Canal, and rode ahead of them to Weissbruck. On a successful <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test, the stocky man is recognised as the one from the Königplatz in Altdorf, who somehow made the oddly gesturing men retreat. It will be easy to remember that those two men turned up dead on the night before the party left Altdorf, shot by crossbow bolts — and this man clearly has a crossbow slung across his back. It is equally obvious that he is watching the <em>Berebeli </em>tie up, but before anyone can approach him Adolphus turns and walks into the inn.</p>\n<p>If the Characters leap from the barge to follow him into the inn, he is nowhere to be seen, having slipped out of the back door. Getting information out of the inn’s occupants requires a successful <strong>Bribery </strong>or <strong>Gossip </strong>Test. A successful Character learns the man is a bounty hunter who arrived in Weissbruck late last night. Whether they learn where he is staying depends on how you wish to run the next part of the adventure.</p>\n<p>Adolphus has no wish to confront the adventurers immediately. Instead, he plans to attack at night and take them by surprise. He did not know that they saw him at the Königplatz and retreated the moment he realised he had been recognised, leaving the inn by a back door and following a winding path back to his lodgings at another inn where a hired gang of local thugs arguably awaits his orders.</p>\n<p>Having seen Adolphus, our Characters may decide to take one of three courses. Enterprising Players may want to go looking for him. More timid souls may prefer to push on to Bögenhafen immediately. It’s very possible the party will stay the night in Weissbruck — perhaps taking greater precautions to secure the barge — and leave for Bögenhafen at first light. The next section is split into two parts: the first deals with what happens if the Characters go looking for Adolphus, the second with what happens should Adolphus’s plan come to fruition. </p>\n<h3>The Trumpet Inn</h3>\n<p>If the Characters head straight to the Trumpet Inn from the Black Gold where they first saw Adolphus, they will see him conversing with three thugs in the barroom. They will not be able to make out what is being said unless they have the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.OXfa9uwG36syzaix]{Lip Reading} or @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.9h82z72XGo9tfgQS]{Acute Sense} Talents.</p>\n<p>A Character may be able to sneak into the room by making a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Stealth (Urban) </strong>Test, and get close enough to overhear without being noticed. </p>\n<p>If the attempt fails, Adolphus and the thugs end their discussion, but do not resort to violence unless attacked. Instead, they stare at the interloper, ready to defend themselves, happy to wait for the other party to make the first move.</p>\n<p>When encountered, Adolphus is instructing one of the thugs, @Actor[r5NgPWpDHpjRkGQM]{Gurt}, @Actor[BLrqbYcSiVvWnmws]{Willie}, and @Actor[rYlDGJx20M72PydJ]{Bengt}, to watch the <em>Berebeli </em>and to follow it after reporting its departure to the bounty hunter. The thug leaves immediately and takes up a position on the bank where he can keep an eye on the barge without being seen. The other two thugs are instructed to call back later in the evening; they finish their drinks and leave about five minutes later. They can be followed to the Black Gold where they spend the next couple of hours drinking.</p>\n<p>If Adolphus is aware the Characters know where he is staying, he leaves the Trumpet Inn by the back door and heads for another inn. The Characters may be able to follow him if they are watching the inn and successfully use a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test to spot him leave and win an <strong>Opposed Stealth (Urban)/Perception</strong> Test to follow him without being noticed. </p>\n<p>Confident of his capabilities, Adolphus attempts to kill any lone Character he spots trailing him. However, he is not reckless, and avoids a fight if there are two or more Characters present.</p>\n<h4>The Bounty Hunter’s Plan</h4>\n<p>Adolphus intends to lead an attack on the <em>Berebeli </em>while it is tied up for the night and most of the crew are asleep. If the Characters hurry on to @JournalEntry[bM1aySQ7ZEKuM9Gl]{Bögenhafen} after spotting him outside the Black Gold Inn, Adolphus follows them and launches his attack at a suitable point during the journey upriver.</p>\n<p>If the barge is left untended, Adolphus and the thugs come aboard and wait for the Characters to return. When they attack, all opponents gain a <a class=\"condition-chat\" data-cond=\"Surprised\"> Surprised</a> Condition unless special preparations are made.</p>\n<h4>Smoke Gets in Your Eyes</h4>\n<p>If the Characters stay with the <em>Berebeli </em>and do not post a guard, Adolphus and the thugs sneak on to the barge at night. If there is a fire burning in the stove, the thugs cover the chimney with a bucket in an attempt to smoke the Characters out. Otherwise, they stuff smouldering, oily rags down the chimney resulting in the same outcome. Characters caught in the thick smoke, whatever its source, must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance</strong> Test each Round or suffer a <a class=\"condition-chat\" data-cond=\"Fatigued\"> Fatigued</a> Condition as coughing fits overwhelm them. One Fatigued Condition gained from the smoke can be removed per Round by spending an Action to recover. </p>\n<p>Characters opening doors or windows for air are greeted by pots of burning oil thrown by the thugs. This is a ranged attack that requires a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Ballistic Skill</strong> Test by the thug concerned, which can be Opposed by Dodge. The burning oil causes +7 Damage and 2 <a class=\"condition-chat\" data-cond=\"Ablaze\"> Ablaze</a> Conditions. If the Thug rolls an <strong>Impressive Failure (−4 SL)</strong> or worse, he instead pours some oil on himself, taking 2 Ablaze Conditions. Characters who make it on to the deck are attacked by Adolphus and any thugs who are not burning.</p>\n<p>If the Characters have set a guard on the barge, Adolphus first tries to disable the guard with his crossbow, firing from cover while the thugs rush from the other direction bearing pots of burning oil. The plan is basically the same: to turn the barge into a raging inferno and attack the occupants as they come out on deck incapacitated by the smoke.</p>\n<h4>Putting the Fire Out</h4>\n<p>While the Characters deal with Adolphus and the thugs, Josef, Wolmar, and Gilda will attempt to put any fires out and, afterwards, try to cast off. Casting off normally takes at least 20 Rounds, but by cutting the ropes this can be reduced to just 6. The mooring ropes have 6 Wounds and a Toughness Bonus of 4. </p>\n<p>Josef, Wolmar, and Gilda should be able to extinguish any fires fairly quickly. Any damage caused during the fight can be repaired the next day by Josef using his Trade (Boatbuilding) Skill.</p>\n<h4>The Letter</h4>\n<p>If Adolphus dies and the Characters search his body, they find Professor Quintus Fassbinder’s letter telling Adolphus to look out for Kastor Lieberung (@JournalEntry[3sAVqZQDe2powR43]{Handout 7: The Letter}), and an accompanying sketch that resembles the Character impersonating Kastor Lieberung. Adolphus used it to help identify the magister impedimentae.  The only indication as to the identity of the letter’s author are the initials: Q.F.</p>\n<p>If Adolphus survives the attack on the barge, the Characters do not find the letter at this time. Instead, they find it after the bounty hunter springs @JournalEntry[4OSdcckInHYhvM81]{his trap in Bögenhafen}. </p>\n<p>Until then, they must remain mystified.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 4 - On To Bögenhafen","sort":75001},"cf":{"id":"temp_4suau1fefeg","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 4 - On To Bögenhafen","color":"#520684"}}}

Small, run-down buildings flank it. A successful <strong>Easy (+40) Lore (Law)</strong> Test — or a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Intelligence</strong> Test for any Burgher or Courtier Character — suspects this is not a likely location for a law firm that handles noble titles and estates.</p>\n<p>@Actor[echM0Sjy5xpt5KAQ]{Adolphus Kuftsos} rented a building about halfway down the alley for his trap. The state of the building depends on whether Adolphus survived the attack on the <em>Berebeli </em>in @JournalEntry[3eKYpGCvUVuC8YFQ]{Weissbruck}.</p>\n<h3>A Dead End</h3>\n<p>If Adolphus died in Weissbruck — and if he has no partner to assist him — there is no sign outside, the windows are shuttered, and the door is locked. There is nothing to make anyone think that this is anything other than an abandoned building. Enquiries along the Garten Weg will be a dead end; no one has ever heard of a law firm by the name of Lock, Stock, and Barl. Indeed, no one has ever heard of a law firm with offices on the Garten Weg. The Characters are advised to ask at the @JournalEntry[3Soi2oRKzGkAdroB]{Town Courts}, but if they do so they are told that no lawyers with those names have ever practised in Bögenhafen, and it is suggested that the letter is a hoax.</p>\n<h3>It's a Trap</h3>\n<p>If Adolphus escaped, or if he has a partner to carry on his mission, the bounty hunter arrives at the building ahead of them. The shutters on the windows have been opened, the door unlocked, and a sign above the door reads, ‘Lock, Stock, and Barl. Lawyers, etc.’</p>\n<p>Inside, a young clerk — actually a law student hired by Adolphus — sits behind a desk, writing in a ledger. He looks up when the Characters enter, and upon being shown the letter and affidavit he smiles broadly.</p>\n<p>‘<em>Herr Barl has been looking forward to meeting you, Herr Lieberung</em>,’ he says. ‘<em>I will let him know that you’ve arrived.</em>’ He takes the two documents and leaves the room through a back door. As the door closes, several other things happen. </p>\n<p>Unseen hands outside the building throw the shutters across the windows, plunging the room into gloom. Bolts can be heard being drawn across the windows and both doors. The Characters are trapped!</p>\n<h4>The Bounty Hunter</h4>\n<p>After a moment, a voice calls through the back door.</p>\n<p>‘<em>Kastor Lieberung! Otherwise known as the magister impedimentae of the cult of the Purple Hand! In the name of the Emperor, I arrest you and your companions for conspiring with Chaos, murder, theft, and other crimes hereinafter to be enumerated! Lay down your weapons and surrender!’</em></p>\n<p>There is a pregnant pause as the Characters weigh their options — and then a terrible sound is heard from outside. Screams echo off the surrounding buildings, accompanied by sickening rending sounds. After a few seconds, everything falls  quiet again.</p>\n<p>The adventurers are still trapped in the building and must find a way out. The doors and windows are bolted (<strong>TB 2, W 6</strong>), but can be broken down fairly easily. If the Characters look in the alley behind the building, they will find the heavily mutilated body of the stocky man whom they glimpsed in Altdorf  and Weissbruck. </p>\n<p>The fresh corpse seems to have been torn apart by some kind of monster. Its chest and belly are ripped open and the heart is torn in two. The body lies in a pool of blood and looping intestines as its empty eyes stare in horror at something that is no longer there.</p>\n<p>A search of the mutilated body turns up the letter from ‘Q.F.’ (@JournalEntry[3sAVqZQDe2powR43]{Handout 7: The Letter}). If the Characters do not immediately search the body, then a corner of the letter is seen sticking out of the dead bounty hunter’s boot. The letter will answer some questions, but it will leave the party with just as many more.</p>\n<h4>Gideon on Guard</h4>\n<p>At this point the Characters have no idea of how or why the bounty hunter died, but they may have the opportunity to find out later in the adventure. @Actor[IvvkdVTJzutEsrlX]{Gideon}, the Daemon of Tzeentch working in agreement with @Actor[LG5qATEIFPE9bezB]{Johannes Teugen}, learned that a bounty hunter had arrived in Bögenhafen and was making enquiries about followers of the Lord of Change. Concluding that this newcomer could be a threat to his plan, Gideon followed him to the building on Garten Weg and, reverting to his Daemon form, ripped him apart before he could do any damage to the Ordo Septenarius.</p>\n<p>Gideon has no idea who the Characters are, or what the bounty hunter wanted with them, and at this point it does not care. The fact that it inadvertently saved the very people who will prove to be the biggest threat to his scheme is simply dramatic irony.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 5 - The False Inheritance","sort":400001},"cf":{"id":"temp_cl9zq7ae6vw","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 5 - The False Inheritance","color":"#7b5611"}}}
{"_id":"61gTe8E6gqbeXRjr","name":"Campaign Themes","content":"<p>Ever since it was first published, gamers and reviewers have commented on the unique tone of the <strong>Enemy Within</strong> campaign. Much of this unique tone comes from the campaign’s underlying themes. </p>\n<p>At the time, all fantasy games were inspired by literature of heroic fantasy or the legends of King Arthur. Low fantasy and dark fantasy were relatively unknown, even as terms — at the time, we described <strong>WFRP </strong>as ‘grubby fantasy’ for want of something better to call it.</p>\n<h3>The Enemy Within</h3>\n<p>The Enemy Within wears a human face, and walks among the everyday folk. While all eyes are on the enemy without, the enemy within walks freely, exchanging cheery greetings with friends and neighbours even as it plots the destruction of the world. </p>\n<p>Using the distraction of the enemy without to their advantage — the vast and twisted hordes of Chaos that lurk beyond the Empire and Kislev to the north, ready to pour across the border and into the Old World without warning — the enemy within is closer and arguably much more dangerous.</p>\n<p>The society of the Empire is riddled with Chaos cults, great and small. Some, like the Purple Hand, are widespread, their plans vast and unguessable; others, like the Ordo Septenarius, are small and local, and may not even know that they serve the Ruinous Powers. As the Characters progress through the campaign, they become more and more aware that anyone they meet could be an agent of Chaos in disguise.</p>\n<h3>Human Frailty</h3>\n<p>Everyone in the Old World is struggling to get along. Everyone wants something: wealth (or at least, enough to eat), safety for themselves and their loved ones, social advancement and the respect of their neighbours, revenge against those who have wronged them, justice (or at least the promise of fair treatment), and happiness (whatever it may mean to each individual). They have similar desires and worries to anyone else, and they will do what they can to satisfy the one and assuage the other.</p>\n<p>Chaos takes advantage of these mortal desires and worries, slipping unnoticed through the gaps into unsuspecting mortal lives. To be avenged, to be feared and respected, and to be strong enough to withstand all manner of threats — these are the promises of Khorne, the Blood God. Wealth, knowledge, power, and advancement are the lures dangled before mortals by Tzeentch, the Great Mutator. Pleasure, comfort, and escape are the temptations offered by Slaanesh, the Prince of Pleasure. Meanwhile sloth, surrender, and fear of mortality attract others to Nurgle, the Father of Decay and Disease.</p>\n<p>It always begins in a small, seemingly innocent way: a means to indulge one’s predilections, a shortcut to a small desire, a dodge to avoid a minor threat or worry. A friend, or the friend of a friend, who knows how to get something done, in exchange for a favour later on. Each time, it becomes easier to give in to the temptation. Each time, one more step is taken away from the mainstream of society, until it is no longer possible to ignore the growing deviancy of one’s tastes and actions. At last, a terrible name is spoken and a soul is damned.</p>\n<p>Witch hunters burn them and society fears them, but whenever a Chaos cult is exposed and its members questioned, one thought runs through countless minds: ‘That could have been me.’</p>\n<h3>Choices of Evils</h3>\n<p>Many fantasy games and stories have a very simplistic morality: heroes are heroes, villains are villains, and never the twain shall meet. Just as <strong>WFRP </strong>eschews the unsullied palaces and consequence-free magic of heroic fantasy for a grubbier and more authentic setting, so too its adventures are at their best when they present players with moral ambiguity.</p>\n<p>Mutants, for example, are a threat to the Empire and the rest of the Old World, and they must be destroyed. But most Mutants are victims themselves: simple farmers, burghers, and normal folk whose bodies started to change for no reason that they understand. Cast out or forced to run for their lives, they do their best to survive in a hostile world, hiding and stealing to get by. Spurned, feared and rejected by everyone else, these Mutants slowly gravitate toward the Ruinous Power of Chaos. How heroic can an adventurer be when faced with a young woman who is pleading for her life with tears pouring from three wide, blue eyes instead of two?</p>\n<h3>Grim Fantasy</h3>\n<p><strong>The Enemy Within</strong> is a low, dark fantasy; or ‘grubby fantasy’ as we used to call it before such terms were coined. <strong>WFRP</strong> Characters are often not especially heroic compared to their lethal counterparts in other fantasy games. Instead of gleaming towers of enchanted stone, the buildings of the Empire are half-timbered, huddled tight like the cities of medieval Europe. Magic is known in the world, but it is not widespread, and it’s dangerous to use. Monsters are known to live in the wildernesses between the islands of civilisation, but the most dangerous enemies are often close neighbours, most of whom are all too human.</p>\n<p>Where other fantasy adventures often take place in perfect weather amid park-like surroundings, the Empire is a place where it often rains — sometimes for hours or days, and usually at the least convenient times. Roads become impassable quagmires, mud sucks at boots, and the cold and damp seeps depressingly into the bones of the hardiest adventurer.</p>\n<h3>Humour vs Horror</h3>\n<p>An essential part of grubby fantasy — and one which is often absent from other games that claim to be low or dark fantasy — is humour. Before <strong>WFRP</strong>, Games Workshop’s <strong>Warhammer </strong>miniatures game included a great deal of humour, often in the form of silly names and thinly-veiled references to pop culture and contemporary events. <strong>WFRP</strong> continued this tradition, and found that elements of farce and low comedy provided a unique and welcome counterpoint to the gritty despair of the world and the cosmic horror of the struggle against Chaos.</p>\n<p>Like the grim gags exchanged by troopers in the trenches of the First World War, each of these jokes represented a small triumph of the human spirit against the overwhelming doom that threatens from within and without. A moment of farce can break the tension of a seemingly hopeless quest; a wry observation can serve as a reminder that life goes on in all its glory and ridiculousness; and the ability to laugh can show that not everything is lost. Used well, humour can make a game far more enjoyable than an endless diet of doom and gloom; used brilliantly, humour can be as poignant as any tragedy.</p>\n<h3>Thinking Enemies</h3>\n<p>The enemies in <strong>The Enemy Within</strong> are not moustache-twirling villains bent on doing evil for evil’s sake. Even the non-Human opponents have goals, desires, and weaknesses that drive them. They do not simply wait in their lairs for heroes to burst in and kill them; they react intelligently, adjust their plans, and provide a shifting, challenging target. In their minds, it is they, and not the Characters, who are the heroes of their own stories and they act accordingly.</p>\n<h3>If It Can Go Wrong</h3>\n<p>Overconfidence is the greatest enemy of the <strong>WFRP </strong>adventurer. If things seem to be going well, most experienced players will start to worry. Without torturing the players, a <strong>WFRP </strong>campaign features a plentiful supply of accidents and happenstances that are frustrating in the moment, but can be amusing in hindsight. More tales are told over Bugman’s ale about mishaps than about glorious triumphs, and nearly all are accompanied by gales of laughter.</p>\n<h3>Brains Over Brawn</h3>\n<p>Fighting is usually the worst possible option for <strong>WFRP </strong>adventurers. Combat is brutal, gory, and often short. Players proceed much farther by using their brains and their non-combat skills — and most Players enjoy this challenge much more than the simple, repetitive process of rolling dice to hit and cause damage.</p>\n<h3>…And More</h3>\n<p>These are some of the themes that generations of players and GMs have found in <strong>The Enemy Within</strong>. Some of them are the result of deliberate design decisions in the original writing; some of them are reflections of the writers’ personality quirks; and some are more or less accidents. It is certain that there are more themes waiting to be identified: some, perhaps, in the written campaign, and many more introduced by Players and GMs, arising from personal taste and random chance until they loom as large for one group as anything written by any game designer. As you play through this new edition of the campaign, keep these established themes in mind, but do not let them dominate: simply notice them when they appear, and take advantage of any opportunities they offer to create a deeper, more entertaining experience. </p>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Introduction","sort":100001},"cf":{"id":"temp_3rf4tb5n579","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Introducción","color":"#185b72"}}}

{"_id":"9vNV4mOPDFnMWykF","name":"Murder Most Foul","content":"<p>When the Characters reach @JournalEntry[OkpN8708mk93iVYZ]{Magirius’s house}, the door is opened by Gideon, still appearing as the ‘servant’ who delivered the message. No matter how quickly the Characters travelled to the house, the servant arrives  before them. </p>\n<p>The servant confirms that Councillor Magirius is expecting the Characters, and shows them to his study, knocking on one of the heavy oak doors and motioning them to enter.</p>\n<p>At first glance, the study appears to be deserted. It is dominated by a huge oak desk, and a heavy wooden chair is overturned behind it. Under the desk, and only visible from behind it, lies the body of @Actor[7rE1jYAeMNKfrgcQ]{Friedrich Magirius}. His throat has been cut, and a widening pool of blood soaks into the carpet.</p>\n<p>As the Characters look at the body, they notice traces of drying blood on the side of the desk — a last, desperate message from Magirius, scrawled in his own blood as he lay dying. </p>\n<p>The message consists of the letters ‘WHSE’ and a number: a 1, followed by a digit that trails off and might be a 3 or a 7. A search of the desk’s drawers turns up nothing of interest, apart from a silver letter-opener (value 15 shillings). Searching Magirius’s body yields a purse containing @Credit[4gc17ss SPLIT]{4GC 17/–} and two gold rings, worth 3GC and 5GC.</p>\n<p>Magirius was trying to tell the Characters that the ritual will take place in @Scene[clYfG9LmEw1J5Kmo]{Warehouse 13}. If the Players have difficulty interpreting the message, allow each Character an <strong>Average (+20) Intelligence </strong>Test. If none of the Characters succeed, any citizen they ask knows that ‘WHSE’ is a standard abbreviation for ‘Warehouse’.</p>\n<p>While the Characters are pondering the meaning of the message, they hear a loud cry of, <em>‘Help! Help! Murder!’</em> from the front door of the house. Looking out of the window, they see a four-man Watch patrol running towards the house. At the same instant, the servant appears in the room, apparently out of thin air — Gideon has called the Watch, and is returning to gloat over the Characters’ imminent arrest.</p>\n<p>‘<em> You know</em>,’ the Daemon says, in a multi-toned, resonant voice that is spine-quiveringly unnatural, ‘<em>you really should have minded your own business</em>.’ It vanishes again, casting @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.2ccKksxXFIMD2YLs]{Shroud of Invisibility}, but its deep, many-throated, mocking laughter continues for a few moments after it has disappeared. </p>\n<p>Note: because of the @Item[c3T3NCS9SPDdEQyy]{Ring of Opsianon} that Gideon wears, its Spells cannot be dispelled.</p>\n<p>You should make it clear to the Players that all the evidence suggests that the Characters have murdered Magirius, and  that the Watch will probably not be impressed by tales of vanishing servants and Daemons. The Characters’ best hope lies in a swift exit.</p>\n<p>If the Characters insist on staying and facing the Watch, they are arrested and imprisoned in the @JournalEntry[1U5VCIKHJZ2ZiF9s]{Watch Barracks} awaiting trial. No one believes the truth, and in due course they are found guilty of Magirius’s murder and sentenced to hang. Assuming Bögenhafen still exists, that is.</p>\n<h3>Framed!</h3>\n<p>Imprisoned and faced with certain death, the Characters are sure to look for a way out of their predicament. The door to the cell is firmly locked and attempts to break it down will only bring the jailor and members of the Watch. A successful <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test (multiple attempts are possible, if required) reveals a Thieves’ sign carved into a slab of stone at the base of one of the walls. A Character with Secret Signs (Thief) recognises it as the mark for ‘escape’. </p>\n<p>The slab can be removed easily and reveals a crawl space behind, wide enough for one Character at a time. After a few yards, this leads to another tunnel giving access to the town’s sewers. From the sewers, the Characters may escape into the town, free but bereft of weapons, armour, or any other trappings.</p>\n<h3>Fleeing the House</h3>\n<p>It is likely that the Characters try to escape rather than face the Watch. The watchmen are coming in through the front of the building, but the party can reach the back door and escape into the garden.</p>\n<p>The Characters should all be able to get away from the Watch, but don’t let the Players know this. You should run this incident in detail, Round by Round, so that the Players think their Characters will be captured unless they make it over the wall in time. The Watch spend about 10 Rounds searching the house before they notice the Characters escaping over the wall. They then charge out after the party. You should build up the tension by telling the Players that their Characters hear noises from inside the house, and then a cry of, ‘<em>In the garden! Quick – they're escaping</em>!’ followed a few Rounds later by the watchmen beginning to come out of the house. The Players should become genuinely worried as their Characters scrabble at the wall, and the first watchman on the scene should miss the last Character over the wall by a matter of inches.</p>\n<p>The wall around the house is 10ft high, and not very easy to climb. It takes a <strong>Difficult (−10) Climb</strong> Test to reach the top. Any Characters reaching the top can help the stragglers over, providing @JournalEntry[7twc3jS1XKVS8KI4]{Assistance}.

{"_id":"AHfbJK5jcrOHIJnS","name":"Blood On The Road","content":"<p>Our Heroes encounter a band of half-starved Mutants who have recently moved into this area. The ravenous band is led by Knud Cratinx, a former sheep rustler who has recently begun to show the mark of Chaos in the form of scales on his skin. Knud and his fellow Mutants have ambushed a Four Seasons coach headed for Altdorf, and are engaged in butchering the occupants. During this encounter the Characters discover the body of Kastor Lieberung (see @JournalEntry[EvAGlPfaaNO6UZXk]{The Story}), and become unwittingly drawn into the web of Chaos that is spreading throughout the Empire. One of the Characters (preferably with a Rogue Career) recognises an old acquaintance who has been mutated by Chaos — a reminder that the taint of the Ruinous Powers is an ever-present threat from which no one is safe.</p>\n<h2>Blood On The Road</h2>\n<p>A couple of hours after the coach joins the main road, it rounds a bend, and comes upon a grisly sight. Squatting in the road is a Human figure, his back to the coach, bent over the body of a Four Seasons coachman. The figure turns, and the Characters see a severed Human hand hanging out of the creature’s disgusting mouth. The creature is recognisably Human, but flesh hangs in tatters from its face and hands, and green ichor seeps from its eyes. Spitting out the hand, it rushes towards the coach brandishing a bloody dagger.</p>\n<p>A Rogue Character (or failing that, a Brass-tier Burgher, Academic, or other urban Character) realises with a shock that this Mutant is Rolf Hurtsis, a fellow thief and old friend from their home town. Give the Player @JournalEntry[kzNux154daZ3YFYK]{Handout 2: Rolf Hurtsis}.</p>\n<p>As Rolf rushes the coach, the horses panic and bolt, snapping the traces as they do so. Hultz, who is gripping the reins, is pulled off the coach and dragged behind them. Gunnar struggles to apply the brakes and stop the coach from crashing into the trees. He succeeds in doing this, but then freezes in fear as Rolf leaps at him. It is up to the adventurers to save the day. If they do nothing, Gunnar gains a Surprised Condition, so is unable to defend himself against the hideous Mutant until the next Round.The coach’s passengers will do nothing unless they themselves are put in danger. If Phillipe is still here, he will come to the aid of the adventurers, using his sword rather than his pistol for fear of hitting an ally. He is a capable fighter, and will be able to identify weaker Characters to help protect them. Marie will stay in the coach to protect her mistress, and will only leave Lady Isolde’s side in order to better protect her noble charge from any incoming threats.  </p>\n<p>Once they have the opportunity to inspect the mutilated body of the Four Seasons coachman, the Characters see a crossbow bolt through the neck has killed him. The coachman wears his sleeved mail shirt, which fits any medium-build Human Character. The tracks of his coach can be seen continuing along the road away from the adventurers, and out of sight around  the bend.</p>\n<h2>Howls On The Wind</h2>\n<p>As the Characters are wondering what to do next, a bestial cry rends the air from around the bend — and crashing sounds can be heard coming through the undergrowth beside the road. Something is coming out of the woods towards them very fast. The adventurers should be tense at this point and may well fire before they recognise @Actor[uzWAvJDoBl0osDnW]{Hultz}, the coachman who was last seen being dragged off by the panicking horses. He runs back to the coach, crying, ‘It’s me, Hultz! Don’t shoot!’ If any of the Characters do fire, they may well kill him, for he has only 2 Wounds left after being dragged through the trees.</p>\n<p>Whether Hultz lives or not, the Characters still have the problem of the runaway horses and the screams from up ahead. The Characters should be encouraged to seek out the source of the screams. If they do not go voluntarily, @Actor[goVesadmHWsl5E98]{Lady Isolde} orders them to. On no account will she or her entourage leave the vicinity of the coach. The coachmen, if still alive, volunteer to look for the horses, but are easily persuaded to wait until later. They won’t investigate the screams. @Actor[NTvkBP3VP4dtBqM0]{Ernst} also wishes to stay out of the way, claiming that he abhors violence.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-eis/assets/set-pictures/rolf-hurtsis2.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 2 - Mistaken Identity","sort":-99999},"cf":{"id":"temp_yfji25xqkd","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 2 - Mistaken Identity","color":"#023582"}}}

During the course of their investigation, they might call at many different locations. Often, they are required to make successful Tests to get information: if, through simple bad luck, they cannot gain enough information to piece the story together, they may become stuck and discouraged. Don’t worry if this happens — there are NPCs aplenty to help the party as they wander around the town, and everything should become clear with a nudge or two. For example, Doctor Malthusius can be used in this way, and tips for doing so are provided. It is quite acceptable to drop a few hints if the Players are having difficulties, but you should avoid making things too easy.</p>\n<h3>Where To Go First?</h3>\n<p>The Characters’ first likely stop is to see Magistrate Richter at the Festival Court. If they have heard the Goblin was killed in a warehouse, they likely want more information. They possibly also want to show Richter the three-socketed pelvis they found as evidence that the creature died in the sewers.</p>\n<p>However, just because that’s the most obvious step, it does not mean the Players will take it. To help you plan for what they may do, this chapter presents all the @JournalEntry[ux99SEKHNfJI66al]{Primary Locations} the Characters are likely to visit as they dig into the story behind the Hidden Temple. Of course, it’s not possible to cover every conceivable route the Characters take as they investigate, but if you read through the @JournalEntry[ux99SEKHNfJI66al]{Primary Locations} and @JournalEntry[HxMaPjWaOWFaTuvo]{A Guide to Bögenhafen}, you will have more than enough information to work through any issue you may face.

If the mapping Character has Art (Cartography), then a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Navigation</strong> Test locates a sewer location from above, with a second located with an <strong>Impressive Success (+4 SL)</strong> or better. If no Character can make maps, well, it’s much harder. </p>\n<p>In order to find any particular location, the Character who made the map must make a successful <strong>Futile (−40) Navigation Test</strong> to find a single location. </p>\n<p>The locations the Characters are most likely to try to trace are the @JournalEntry[IX0BMZqgv05tWePI]{Steinhäger Offices} above the @JournalEntry[uQ1sgSTE6W2Gwlgk]{Hidden Temple}, and @JournalEntry[pb4RWXHJMUXmHhTD]{The Crossed Pikes} above the door to the Crossed Pikes. Manholes can also be traced above ground, provided that they have been marked on the Characters’  map.</p>\n<h3>Stake-Outs</h3>\n<p>The Characters may decide to stake out a location. Some of the more likely locations, and what is seen there, are detailed in the descriptions throughout this chapter.

{"_id":"D5FkUrwpwDQkVMRK","name":"On To Bögenhafen...","content":"<p>Altdorf offers endless attractions and opportunities for adventure, but it is time for our Heroes to leave the capital and head to Bögenhafen, where the next part of the campaign awaits. Josef is going there, so they have the offer of a free ride and a little pay to sweeten the bargain. They also have the letter from the lawyers that holds out the promise of wealth and ennoblement for one ‘Kastor Lieberung’. In addition, Josef claims Bögenhafen’s festival, the Schaffenfest, is a good place to find employment.</p>\n<p>In theory, the Characters should need no further encouragement to head to Bögenhafen, but if they show any inclination to spend more time in Altdorf you can use the following news to hasten their departure.</p>\n<h3>Murder at Night</h3>\n<p>After leaving the Boatman Inn, it seems that the two young nobles continued their slumming, upsetting more people, until at last a vicious fight broke out in the Black Bull, one of the dockside’s roughest dives. One of the nobles was killed, and their bodyguards fled. In the morning, the riverfront is buzzing with the news. Word passes to Josef that the Watch are looking for the Characters, who were seen to run afoul of the nobles in the Boatman Inn earlier in the evening. </p>\n<p>Someone seems to think the Characters followed their tormentors and exacted a violent revenge, and given the status of the deceased, justice seems a distant prospect. A successful <strong>Easy (+40) Lore (Law)</strong> or <strong>Lore (Reikland or Altdorf ) </strong>Test makes this very clear.</p>\n<p>Unless the Characters are feeling foolhardy, they should be eager to head for Bögenhafen as quickly as possible. By the time they return to Altdorf the true culprits will have been caught and the heat will be off, but for now, Josef — and anyone else they befriended in the Boatman — advises them in the strongest possible terms to get out of the city as quickly as possible if they wish to avoid a rushed trial and summary execution.</p>\n<h2>Leaving Altdorf</h2>\n<p>Josef and his crew, possibly including the Characters, free the <em>Berebeli </em>from its moorings and guide the barge into the Kaiser Reik, the largest channel of water passing through Altdorf. As Josef calls out orders with a grin, ropes tauten, sails fill, and the barge is soon cutting through the waters, heading downstream. </p>\n<p>In less than an hour, the <em>Berebeli </em>is sailing into the Reiksport, Altdorf ’s massive, natural harbour that lies outside the city walls. There, the majority of the capital’s docklands and shipyards can be found. </p>\n<p>Warships of the Imperial First Fleet are anchored everywhere, pennants flying, cannons bristling on every deck. Many of the ships, which come in all sizes, have never seen the sea. The city of Marienburg, at the mouth of the River Reik many hundreds of miles downstream, charges extortionate taxes for any warships passing through, so the Empire’s fleet only rarely leaves the Reik. </p>\n<p>Josef explains all this with a jovial smile as he drinks wine at the tiller. He points out the truly enormous greatship Emperor Wilhelm III, said to have a crew of over a thousand, and claims it has never left the Reiksport in its 70 years of service. He also identifies several prison hulks, and happily states they are ruled by the river criminals they are supposed to incarcerate.</p>\n<p>Once beyond the Imperial Navy’s finest, Josef steers the <em>Berebeli </em>southwards, heading for @JournalEntry[MBMhy4NrPeACDEYl]{The Weissbruck Canal}.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-eis/assets/set-pictures/reik.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 4 - On To Bögenhafen","sort":1},"cf":{"id":"temp_4suau1fefeg","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 4 - On To Bögenhafen","color":"#520684"}}}

His clerk, Andrea, asks why the Characters are here, and tells them to call back in 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>When the Characters are finally shown in to see @Actor[P3HlNMK6rubzDoxM]{Magistrate Richter}, he explains that the Goblin was crushed by falling crates in a warehouse on The Ostendamm about an hour after the party entered the sewers.

Successfully appealing to the gods (see @JournalEntry[HN7vwt4LKu2WXWa9]{Little Prayers}) at a temple results in a ‘message’ coming as an unbidden thought or feeling. If a Character has the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.Nj3tC8A5fZ3zEdMR]{Holy Visions} Talent, this ‘message’ comes in strongly, and without any need to pray. </p>\n<p>You should add bonuses as you feel are appropriate to the Little Prayers Test if the praying Character is especially pious, has made an appropriate donation lately, or has the Pray Skill. </p>\n<p>If you prefer, the god’s presence and concern may manifest further. Perhaps a sudden breeze snuffs out candles, sconces light without any visible cause, or a statue cries tears. Should a priest witness such a minor miracle, its veracity is quickly ascertained, and the blessed Character is likely to be approached to join the cult. This could be a good way to initiate a Career change if a Character wishes to join a cult. </p>\n<p>The following are some sample ‘messages’ the gods may send.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bögenauer</strong>: My river will run dry and trade will stop. Move, now, lest all be forever poisoned.</li>\n<li><strong>Handrich</strong>: Bögenhafen heads for disaster. Wealth and comfort will be replaced by poverty and misery.</li>\n<li><strong>Morr</strong>: Those who lust for profit bring inestimable death. None will survive here.</li>\n<li><strong>Myrmidia</strong>: A great strategy unfolds. The rich who believe they bring greater wealth by their deeds are instead being played to their deaths.</li>\n<li><strong>Ranald</strong>: Dangerous lies are told: one lied to one, who lied to seven, who lied to seven by seven. </li>\n<li><strong>Rhya</strong>: The grinning moon laughs as all falls impotent, sterile, and dead. Act, lest this land be lost.</li>\n<li><strong>Sigmar</strong>: The Empire is threatened here. This town is being infiltrated by the Great Enemy.</li>\n<li><strong>Shallya</strong>: Greed is a sickness spreading a great disease into the heart of the Empire!</li>\n<li><strong>Taal</strong>: The town is hunted. If it falls, all is corruption and I will never reclaim this site.</li>\n<li><strong>Ulric</strong>: Prepare! The weak, seeking short-cuts to strength, are deceived. They bring war and destruction to this realm. </li>\n<li><strong>Verena</strong>: Magic does not change the rules of commerce. Instead, it unjustly breaks the laws of reason.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>The Temple of Bögenauer</h4>\n<p>The Characters cannot find a priest at the @JournalEntry[8m8jn1P3YMT5X3Gl]{Temple of Bögenauer}. The temple itself is filled with offerings to the god, given in the hope he allows a bountiful Schaffenfest. Disturbingly, a vague feeling of foreboding overcomes the Characters if they enter the temple. This feeling grows as Teugen’s ceremony approaches, but never becomes overpowering. </p>\n<p>If a Character with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.Nj3tC8A5fZ3zEdMR]{Holy Visions} Talent enters the temple, they receive a harrowing vision of Bögenhafen collapsing into a howling vortex of magic as a Chaos Gate opens in the middle of the town. Daemons are everywhere, and screaming townsfolk form their banquet. As suddenly as it arrives, the vision is gone, resulting in a @Condition[Prone] Condition for the Character.</p>\n<h4>The Temple of Shallya</h4>\n<p>Marlene Rubenstein is the sole representative of the @JournalEntry[UGEvvnQ1UyuS1XGY]{Temple of Shallya}. She sees to the day-to-day running of the temple and its infirmary, and also organises a soup kitchen attached to the Mercy House in @JournalEntry[grwHk2gk79i0jRdV]{The Pit}. </p>\n<p>She is aided on a regular basis by 12 women from the town, who she calls her ‘Congress of Doves’. There is only a 35% chance that she is at the temple or the soup kitchen when the Characters call, as she spends large amounts of her time visiting the sick in their homes.</p>\n<p>If the Characters meet her, they find her very friendly. If asked about the Ordo Septenarius, she tells them that it often makes donations to the temple. If asked who makes these donations, she names @Actor[7rE1jYAeMNKfrgcQ]{Friedrich Magirius} and  @Actor[Coxv92EfL6VmlpCS]{Franz Steinhäger}, and notes their benevolent natures.</p>\n<h4>The Temple of Verena</h4>\n<p>The @JournalEntry[tfwWr00IoEoCOBvn]{Temple of Verena} is run by Mother Greta Harbokka. Greta is 45 years old and has lived in Bögenhafen all her life. She is very knowledgeable regarding the town and its inhabitants. Characters enquiring here can get general information on the four major merchant families and on @Actor[LG5qATEIFPE9bezB]{Johannes Teugen}.</p>\n<p>Mother Greta answers any polite questions without need of a Test. If asked about the Ordo Septenarius, Greta explains it is the title of a semi-secret organisation operating mainly within the @JournalEntry[hrsJhUcotaRHdmMn]{Merchants' Guild}. She thinks that its title implies that it may be based around the number seven in some way. She knows that donations have been made in this name to the temples of Shallya and Bögenauer. She first became aware of the organisation about two years ago.</p>\n<p>As well as talking to Greta, Characters may use the temple’s extensive library. A Character must have @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.GogGbYxkVdCmiKqf]{Read/Write} Talent in order to use it. A successful<strong> Average (+20) Research</strong> or <strong>Hard (−20) Intelligence</strong> Test gleans one of the following pieces of information. </p>\n<p>Each attempt, whether successful or not, takes two hours if the Character has the Research Skill, four hours otherwise. Greta does this on the Characters’ behalf if they provide a suitable donation (@Pay[10ss]{10 shillings} or more, or maybe a book containing rare lore), or if they pass a <strong>Very Hard (−30) Charm</strong> Test.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Merchant Families</strong>: For information on the four big merchant families, see @JournalEntry[RuqDBFEu6BTWCKLw]{Merchant Houses}. A separate roll is required for each family.</li>\n<li><strong>The Grinning Moon</strong>: References in the library refer to Morrslieb, the second moon and its suspected relationship to Chaos, including the following piece of information: ‘<em>Lo! When the Beloved of Mórr doth GROW and its SKULL GRINS unnaturally, the Time of Change has come! The Great Mutator shall then take His pleasure and mortals will feed His hunger.’</em></li>\n<li><strong>Karl Teugen</strong>: A journal can be found in the library. It was written in a wild and shaky hand by @Actor[8DRfC5Nmp4Wi7m1T]{Ulthar the Unstable}, but he did not sign his work: ‘<em>Karl Teugen is suffering from a strange illness, the physicians have failed to help him and soon he will die. I tell them that Daemons walk and he has been taken, but they do not listen!’ </em>This is followed by another entry.<em> ‘Karl Teugen died today, his face was purple and his eyes bulged from his head. His tongue hung from his face like a great, bloated snake. The Mark of the Ruinous Powers is upon him and upon all of Bögenhafen!’</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Greta knows nothing of the journal, but does know that Karl Teugen died and his brother, Johannes, came to run the family business.

Esto llevaría a un debilitamiento del baluarte más fuerte del Viejo Mundo contra las fuerzas del Caos, lo que allanaría el camino para una incursión de los Desiertos del Norte del Caos.</p>\n<p>Sin embargo, ese día todavía está muy lejos y esta secta del Caos de momento es sólo una de varias que se esfuerzan por llevar a los Poderes Ruinosos al corazón del Viejo Mundo de diversas maneras. Y, por suerte para éste, se siguen entorpeciendo entre ellas demasiado a menudo.</p>\n<h3>Kastor Lieberung</h3>\n<p>Este hombre perteneció a la Mano Púrpura durante la mayor parte de su malvada y corrupta vida. Por méritos propios, consiguió con rapidez una posición de cierto poder en la célula de Nuln.</p>\n<p>Como <em>magister impedimentae</em>, su principal deber era adquirir lo que la secta requiriera por cualquier medio necesario. Entre otras cosas, fue responsable de organizar una campaña de secuestros para satisfacer la constante necesidad de la secta de víctimas para sacrificios.</p>\n<p>Cuando una sectaria –la hermana Beatha– intentaba secuestrar a un comerciante, la capturaron, la torturaron y lo confesó; pero, por suerte para Lieberung, sólo conocía a su superior por el título. Temiendo por su seguridad, Kastor huyó de Nuln y se fue Middenheim. En esta ciudad se unió a otra célula y siguió fomentando las ambiciones de la Mano Púrpura.</p>\n<p>Las autoridades de Nuln fueron incapaces de determinar la identidad del <em>magister impedimentae</em> y, al final, abandonaron la investigación, frustradas. Pero algunos se mostraron reacios a cerrar el caso, y pronto comenzó una nueva investigación. Se ofreció una suma generosa por la cabeza del misterioso <em>magister impedimentae</em>, y muchos cazarrecompensas quisieron hacerse con ella. De éstos, unos cuantos investigaron demasiado las actividades de la secta y desaparecieron. Otros se cansaron de perseguir a un fantasma, se dieron por vencidos y fueron tras presas más fáciles.</p>\n<p>Pero un cazarrecompensas, @Actor[echM0Sjy5xpt5KAQ]{Adolphus Kuftsos}, logró infiltrarse en los niveles inferiores de la Mano Púrpura. Cuando se enteró de que el magister impedimentae había abandonado Nuln para irse a Middenheim tras el chapucero secuestro, comenzó la caza.</p>\n<p>Con el objeto de ganarle la partida a esta presa, Adolphus pasó primero por Altdorf y contactó con el profesor Quintus Fassbinder, de la universidad de esa ciudad. El profesor Fassbinder tenía la autorización del anterior Emperador, Luitpold III, para estudiar y catalogar las múltiples sectas del Caos y sus miembros. Esta investigación le había hecho reparar en la Mano Púrpura. Supo decirle al cazador de recompensas mucho sobre el cometido del <em>magister impedimentae</em> y darle algunas pistas para localizar al fugitivo. Entre ellas había un nombre: Kastor Lieberung.</p>\n<p>El plan de Adolphus era sacar al magister de su escondite con la promesa de una lucrativa herencia, que incluía una pequeña hacienda y un título menor. Envió una carta a la última dirección conocida de Kastor, en Nuln, para atraerlo a una trampa en el mercado de Bögenhafen. </p>\n<p>A su debido tiempo, un sectario de Nuln envió la carta a Middenheim, y Kastor partió de inmediato a hacerse con ese dinero caído del cielo. Con Kastor establecido como un noble terrateniente, los planes de la secta para desbaratar el Imperio avanzarían mucho. De camino, Kastor recibió instrucciones de contactar con la célula de la Mano Púrpura en Altdorf, que le prestaría toda la ayuda que necesitara.</p>\n<h3>El Doble</h3>\n<p>Kastor nunca llegó a Altdorf ni nunca lo hará. Ha muerto a manos de unos mutantes en un ataque fortuito a la diligencia. Su cuerpo espera a ser descubierto por los Personajes, uno de los cuales tiene un asombroso parecido con el sectario.</p>\n<p>El cazarrecompensas no es el único problema que tendrá doble: como no logrará contactar con la célula de la Mano Púrpura en Altdorf, la secta concluirá que el <em>magister impedimentae</em> ha cambiado de bando y planea traicionarlos y quedarse con el dinero.</p>\n<h3>Las sombras se oscurecen</h3>\n<p>Al llegar al mercado de la ciudad, los PJs se dirigen al despacho del abogado –donde uno de ellos va a enriquecerse con la firma de unos papeles– sólo para toparse en una emboscada. Después de librase del cazarrecompensas de una vez por todas, quizá quieran tomarse unos días y disfrutar de las diversas atracciones de la feria anual. Diversiones aparte, una feria local puede ser un buen lugar para encontrar empleo.</p>\n<p>Cuando un simple trabajo lleve a un descubrimiento espeluznante, el grupo se verá envuelto en una conspiración mortal que involucrará a algunos ciudadanos prominentes de la población. Las autoridades locales no van a aceptar la palabra de un abigarrado grupo de extraños contra la de familias que dirigen la economía de la ciudad y pagan los salarios de todos. Los aventureros tendrán que salvar Bögenhafen por su cuenta, y al hacerlo es probable que los tachen de delincuentes.</p>\n<h3>Consecuencias</h3>\n<p>Si los aventureros no logran salvar Bögenhafen, será desastroso, ya que se abrirá una Puerta del Caos dentro de la población (que es posible que se vea borrada del mapa por completo). Si tienen éxito, la sociedad y la política de la población quedarán patas arriba y nadie les dará las gracias, ni siquiera les creerá. En cualquier caso, una salida rápida es recomendable y –con un golpe de suerte inusitado– uno de sus pocos amigos tendrá una barcaza fluvial. Dejarán atrás Bögenhafen y se dirigirán río abajo a la siguiente etapa de la campaña <strong>El Enemigo Interior: Muerte en el Reik</strong>.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Introduction","sort":1},"cf":{"id":"temp_3rf4tb5n579","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Introducción","color":"#185b72"}}}

The Watch stopped a drover from Averland trying to sell a mare with nine eyes blistered in her mouth! She’s now hanging from the East Gate.</em><br />This rumour helps set the scene in the Empire; you can decide whether it is true or not, and whether it was the mare or the drover who was hanged<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>The Countess of Nuln’s niece had a wizard murder a love-rival at a Black Powder Week party a few weeks ago. But that’s typical for Nuln, I hear.</em><br />Partially true. For more on @Actor[J8AHNs6dcy40mhXr]{Gravin Maria Ulrike}, the Countess’s niece, see <strong>Rough Nights &amp; Hard Days</strong>.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>The river Bögen is plagued by mutants. Three barges were sunk on the stretch from Castle Grauenburg in the last month. The graf needs to invest more in riverwardens!<br /></em>True, as the Characters will find out at the start of the next part of <strong>The Enemy Within</strong>, <strong>Death on the Reik.<br /><br /></strong></li>\n<li><em>There's a tale that a twin-tailed comet was spotted above Lachenbad, but seen nowhere else. </em><br />This rumour sets the scene for the Empire and the End Times, where portentous events are becoming more commonplace.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>The Duke of Midwald was found swinging from the High Oak of Bluttal, his eyes pecked free by ravens. His people hung him for having Ulrican sympathies after he returned from Altdorf with three new wolfhounds.</em><br />This rumour sets the scene of current events in the Empire; you decide whether it is true or not.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>The Emperor has turned his back on the Colleges of Magic, that’s why he commissioned the Imperial Engineers School to build his new messenger towers. It’s about time the Emperor saw sense and got rid of those witches!</em><br />Partially true, as becomes clear in the next part of The Enemy Within, Death on the Reik.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>My cousin recently returned from Altdorf with black hair. But it was always blonde before that. She swears I’m lying, but I’m not!</em><br />Possibly true. Something is very wrong in Altdorf, and things do change there, as explained in @JournalEntry[aZNjpWmxYygMwKFy]{Adventuring in the Capital}.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>The hamlet of Stust was overrun by mutants and beastmen from the forests. All that remains are piles of skulls and broken bones.</em><br />This rumour is for setting the scene; you can decide whether it is true or not. It probably is.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>@Actor[LG5qATEIFPE9bezB]{Councillor Teugen} only attends guild meetings in the evenings. He’s had the entire Merchants’ Guild timetables reorganised to his nocturnal preferences.</em><br />This rumour is common across Bögenhafen, but like most rumours regarding Teugen, it somewhat misses the mark.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>The mists down the Bögen are getting worse. Mark my words, that means trouble!</em><br />Probably true. The mists on the Bögen are heavier every year, and trouble is indeed coming to Bögenhafen.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>The sewers of Bögenhafen are no longer patrolled! What is the town council doing? Things live down there now!</em><br />This rumour is all too true. The Ordo Septenarius does what it can to ensure its activities below Bögenhafen remain unobserved.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>Father Huss, a bear of a Sigmarite from the north, passed through Bögenhafen last month and demanded entrance to the High Temple of Sigmar. Who ever heard of a northern Sigmarite? Of course, he was turned away!</em><br />Partially true. Father Luthor Huss, a Sigmarite, did pass through Bögenhafen recently, and he is from the north. However, the assumption that he was turned away is simple prejudice.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>If you see a crow, you take it down and nail it to a crow post! Crows are the eyes of the Dark Gods, don’t you know. But don’t get them mixed up with ravens. You don’t want to attract Morr’s attention!</em><br />This rumour sets the scene; you decide the truth of it.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>I saw a whole regiment of those Trott mercenaries marching south towards Schrabwald. There must be trouble brewing in the Vorbergland.</em><br />True. There is trouble brewing in the Vorbergland. A recent alliance between House Trott and House Jungfreud has resulted in a significant military build-up near Ubersreik. For more on this, refer to the <strong>Ubersreik Almanacs</strong> and the <strong>WFRP Starter</strong> <strong>Set</strong>.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>The Emperor has issued a new edict declaring that there are no Mutants in the Empire. The practice of exiling or slaughtering those unfortunate enough to carry some sort of physical deformity purely because of their appearance is henceforth illegal and punishable by death.<br /></em>This rumour is, somewhat unbelievably, entirely true. It hits Bögenhafen the same day as the Characters arrive, and is the talk of every tavern and beer tent. The reasons why the Emperor would allow such an edict are explained in the last instalment of The Enemy Within, Empire in Ruins, and cause significant political upheaval everywhere.</li>\n</ul>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 6 - The Schaffenfest","sort":50001},"cf":{"id":"temp_7b2zg73jxz3","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 6 - The Schaffenfest","color":"#717315"}}}

If you add more, it is suggested you only provide enough to convey the impression of a bustling town going about its business, but not so many that the Players become distracted or overwhelmed.</p>\n<h3>Day 1</h3>\n<h4>Doctor Malthusius</h4>\n<p>The Characters should encounter @Actor[kQyaJB0lSLQ2NLu8]{Doctor Malthusius} during the first day of their investigations. They may decide to call on him to tell him what they found in the sewers. If they do not, you can have Doctor Malthusius run into them in the town or near the @JournalEntry[kahbAL4tUYjxkbCp]{Festival Court}.</p>\n<p>Malthusius is sure they did their best to recover the Goblin, and holds no grudge against them. He invites them to his caravan and offers them brandy and tobacco. Malthusius has heard that the Goblin was killed in a warehouse by the river, and is rueful at the loss of his best exhibit. He realises that the townspeople would not have been interested in taking it alive, but he is baffled that the @JournalEntry[XiqWDGqJgQjX1evx]{Town Hall} clerk steadfastly refuses his requests that they return the body to him. He wants to have the Mutant Goblin stuffed and mounted as a static display. He cannot imagine why the locals refuse to hand the Goblin’s body back to him, since it could be of no conceivable use to anyone else.</p>\n<p>If the Characters tell him about the Hidden Temple and suggest the Goblin was killed there by a Daemon, Malthusius is disbelieving at first. Are the Characters sure that what they saw wasn’t a trick of the shadows and echoes? A successful <strong>Average (+20) Charm</strong> Test (or the sight of the Goblin’s pelvis) convinces Malthusius that the Characters are serious, and then he starts to think. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘So that must have been why the authorities refused to hand over the body. There wasn’t one after the Daemon had finished with it!’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Malthusius doesn't take any direct role in investigations. He explains he avoids making powerful enemies, and doesn't want Witch Hunters interrupting his show. And, anyway, he is moving on when the fair ends. At the same time, the prospect of Daemons in a seemingly ordinary town like Bögenhafen worries him. He is torn between a desire to do something about it and his conviction that it is wise to avoid such things.</p>\n<p>If he can help without running any personal risk, he does so gladly. If the Players are at a loss as to what to do next, Malthusius can be used to feed a couple of leads. Unfortunately, he cannot provide any contacts. He can also suggest that the library in the @JournalEntry[tfwWr00IoEoCOBvn]{Temple of Verena} may have some useful information.</p>\n<p>If Gottri is mentioned, Malthusius offers to ask around at the fair. By the end of the day, he uncovers that the Dwarf was seen shortly after sunset, heading into the town in the company of a young man wearing livery including a red cross or flower.</p>\n<h4>Madman in the Square</h4>\n<p>The Characters overhear a conversation about a madman standing in one of the town’s squares. Apparently, he is ranting and raving and making all sorts of pronouncements of doom. He is not in the square if the Characters go there, but he returns on Day 2.</p>\n<h3>Day 2</h3>\n<h4>The Prophet of Doom</h4>\n<p>The Characters encounter a filthy-looking wretch with long, straggly hair by the name of Ulthar. He stands in one of the town squares amid a small crowd of people, shouting and shaking his fist at nothing in particular. </p>\n<p>Most of the time he yells the same four lines: ‘<em>Doomed! We are all doomed! Chaos is upon us! The signs are everywhere!’ </em></p>\n<p>However, occasionally, his rantings take a different line: <em>‘I see seven, and I see nine, all they have will be mine, mine, mine!’ or, ‘The star within the circle is the sign of Death!’ </em>and<em>, ‘Beware the man who is not a man!’</em></p>\n<p>If the Characters approach Ulthar, he stares closely at one of them — ideally, the Character who resembles Kastor Lieberung. ‘<em>The Mark is upon you!’</em> he yells, with sudden vehemence. ‘<em>Beware the bringers of Chaos</em>!’ Then he turns and runs into the crowd, heading for @JournalEntry[Hv9Y78wUFbsG66Cb]{Kringler’s Ferry} and @JournalEntry[grwHk2gk79i0jRdV]{The Pit}.</p>\n<p>If the Characters follow Ulthar, they need to make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test or they lose him in the crowd. If they succeed, they just have time to see him board the ferry, which leaves before they can reach it. Otherwise, they can make enquiries in the crowd, perhaps using the Gossip Skill, and find out that he lives in the Pit. Finding him there requires a successful <strong>Bribery</strong> Test and costs at least @Pay[3ss]{3 shillings}.</p>\n<p>If and when the Characters find Ulthar’s hovel, there is no reply to their knocks. On entering, they will find his twisted body on the floor, his throat ripped out. @Actor[IvvkdVTJzutEsrlX]{Gideon} became aware of Ulthar’s pronouncements and silenced him. Searching the body, the Adventurers find only fleas and a medallion bearing the House of Teugen’s insignia, which Karl Teugen gave to Ulthar on his death bed.</p>\n<p>If the Characters saw @Actor[echM0Sjy5xpt5KAQ]{Adolphus Kuftsos}’s mutilated body outside the fake lawyers’ office on Garten Weg, a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test means they find Ulthar’s wounds disturbingly familiar.</p>\n<h4>The Evil Eye</h4>\n<p>During the afternoon, @Actor[IvvkdVTJzutEsrlX]{Gideon} watches the Characters closely. Any Characters with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.mNoCuaVbFBflfO6X]{Sixth Sense} Talent have a feeling of being watched, but are unable to determine who is watching them. Any minor NPC the Characters question this afternoon has a good chance of being dead by the time they return with more questions, but they never see Gideon.</p>\n<h4>The Invitation</h4>\n<p>While watching @Actor[7rE1jYAeMNKfrgcQ]{Friedrich Magirius} or @Actor[Coxv92EfL6VmlpCS]{Franz Steinhäger}, the Characters notice a piece of parchment fall from the suspect’s pocket. Magirius or Steinhäger are unaware that this has happened. The Characters are able to pick it up and read it. Give the Players @JournalEntry[g6zZWoBiMmoIdwXT]{Handout 8: Hour After Sunset}.</p>\n<p>This event can be used in a number of different ways. For example, if the Characters are not actually watching either of the above, but happen to be watching their houses or places of work, they could see the note lying in the road or just inside the gates.</p>\n<h4>Hired Muscle</h4>\n<p>Just after nightfall, nine men converge on the Characters from all directions. All are dressed in rough, tattered clothing, and they are carrying clubs, chair legs, and similar weapons. If the adventurers are indoors at the time, they are approached by only one of the thugs, but the others stand threateningly in the background. Teugen has hired the thugs to scare the Characters off. None of the thugs knows who they are actually working for. They are following instructions from Gurney at the @JournalEntry[KoTTFOzxJmVi6EPe]{Stevedores' Guild}.</p>\n<p>On a successful <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test, it is noticed that some of them wear cheap metal pendants showing a rope-and-pulley emblem. A successful <strong>Easy (+40) Lore (Bögenhafen)</strong>, <strong>Average (+20) Lore (Reikland),</strong> or a <strong>Challenging (+0) Intelligence</strong> Test (with a bonus of +20 for Characters who have completed a stevedore or merchant Career) identify the emblem as being that of the Stevedores' Guild. </p>\n<p>Once the Characters are surrounded, one of the thugs speaks: ‘<em>We've got a message for you. Keep your noses out of what don’t concern you, or you might wake up one morning at the bottom of the river. Why don't you try your luck somewhere else, eh? I hear Altdorf is lovely at this time of year</em>.’ The thugs will then disperse. They take no aggressive action unless attacked or provoked.</p>\n<h3>Day 3 - The Day Before the Ritual</h3>\n<p>Note: If the Characters are making good progress, the events listed for this day can be used on Day 2.</p>\n<h4>The Meeting</h4>\n<p>In the evening, Teugen asks the Inner Council of the Ordo Septenarius to assemble for a meeting at his house on @JournalEntry[OkpN8708mk93iVYZ]{The Adel Ring} an hour after sunset. Teugen calls the meeting to finalise the ritual with his Inner Council. The Characters may have found out about the meeting from a letter dropped by @Actor[7rE1jYAeMNKfrgcQ]{Friedrich Magirius} or by @Actor[Coxv92EfL6VmlpCS]{Franz Steinhäger}, or they might be spying on the Adel Ring as the Inner Council members assemble for the meeting. At this time of night, there is a certain amount of activity in the Adel Ring. It is not just Magirius, Steinhäger, Teugen and the rest of the council abroad at this hour. @Actor[nCzNGuS22drsDAIe]{The Watch patrol} can be seen doing their duty of protecting the citizens, and they ignore the occasional group of rowdy young rakes leaving for a night on the town. Others are crossing the Adel Ring for dinner engagements, generally accompanied by servants with torches and cudgels to ward off footpads. Romantic assignations, and possibly even a duel, may also be taking place in the park. </p>\n<p>This ‘background noise’ is left to your discretion. Refer to the @JournalEntry[EEGZQJisFqmgyt7P]{The Adel Ring} for inspiration. You could add extra hazards in the form of aggressive young blades, overzealous bodyguards, and suspicious Watchmen. You could even add some possible red herrings: for example, several people may come out of the Magirius or Steinhäger houses — most of them bound for perfectly innocent destinations. </p>\n<p>The Characters could have trouble identifying @Actor[Coxv92EfL6VmlpCS]{Franz Steinhäger} or Actor[Friedrich Magirius] in the twilight, leading to a certain amount of confusion. If the Characters accost any of the NPCs, there is a good chance that they will be taken for footpads and dealt with accordingly. Use your discretion here — keep the Characters on their toes, but avoid putting them in impossible situations they cannot escape.</p>\n<p>@Actor[7rE1jYAeMNKfrgcQ]{Friedrich Magirius} returns from his work at the @JournalEntry[hrsJhUcotaRHdmMn]{Merchants' Guild}, and remains in @JournalEntry[feLRH5eehntGHeBB]{his house} for about an hour. He then leaves carrying a package containing his Ordo Septenarius robes, and crosses the Adel Ring to @JournalEntry[zJ6UCYLo8v2UViw6]{Teugen House}. If the Characters approach him, Magirius wishes them a good evening and continues on his way. If they make it impossible for him to avoid them, he explains that he is going to dinner with his friend, Councillor Teugen, and could they please make way. If the Characters persist, he calls for help and tries to push his way past.</p>\n<p>@Actor[Coxv92EfL6VmlpCS]{Franz Steinhäger} emerges from @JournalEntry[6TkifCmqAJgeKMvI]{his house} ten minutes after Magirius. He is accompanied by his two bodyguards, and he too carries his robes. If the Characters try to stop or question him, he will assume that they are footpads and call for help while his bodyguards (use the @Actor[JOvvyUSDLR5XkN9R]{Thugs} profile) move to protect him.</p>\n<p>Over the next half hour, after Magirius and Steinhäger have entered the house, another five visitors arrive. All are on foot and well-dressed, and each carries a bundle. Some are in the company of bodyguards, and nearly all come from houses near the @JournalEntry[EEGZQJisFqmgyt7P]{The Adel Ring}.</p>\n<p>The Characters should be discouraged from gatecrashing this meeting, as it’s clear there are many well-armed folk in attendance. Until the last visitor arrives, the gates are open and two servants stand by them. If the Characters try to enter through the gates, they are politely, but firmly, turned away by the servants. </p>\n<p>They claim a private event is taking place, and that strangers are not welcome. If the Characters insist on staying, two bodyguards wearing sleeved chain mail coats suggest they are not wanted. If the group persists and tries to push through the gates, the bodyguards attack, backed up by another two who have been waiting on the other side of the gates.</p>\n<p>Once the last guest has arrived, the servants close and lock the gates. Two bodyguards stay here while the other two patrol the grounds. There are three guard dogs that are then released. These do not bother the bodyguards or the servants, but anyone else in the grounds is fair game. Details of the grounds can be found on @JournalEntry[zJ6UCYLo8v2UViw6]{here}.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Teugen tells the Inner Council that the secret temple has been discovered and abandoned. So the ritual will take place on the following evening, in a new location, which will be revealed to them later. Further instructions will be forthcoming nearer the time. Remember, the others think the ritual is to tamper with market forces and make them all rich; Teugen plans to sacrifice the rest of them to save his soul; and Gideon knows that it will create a tear into the Realms of Chaos on the site of the town. After the meeting, @Actor[7rE1jYAeMNKfrgcQ]{Friedrich Magirius} has doubts about the ethics of Teugen’s plan, as Teugen mentioned that a human sacrifice would constitute part of the ritual. After struggling with this for a while, Magirius decides to contact the Characters (see @JournalEntry[Ul8IrCSg3If4QW7l]{The Darkest Hour}).</p>\n<h3>Day 4 - The Day of the Ritual</h3>\n<h4>The Watchers</h4>\n<p>Two @Actor[JOvvyUSDLR5XkN9R]{thugs} follow the Characters during the day and, if they persist in their enquiries, nine thugs will return and attempt to catch the Characters in a secluded spot. They plan to beat every member of the party unconscious, strip them of any valuables, and dump them into the river. If the Characters manage to fight off the thugs, they return again later.</p>\n<p>Once fighting begins, each Round there is a @Roll[1d10]{50%} chance that the town @Actor[nCzNGuS22drsDAIe]{Watch} arrives after [[/gmr 1d10]] Rounds. If this happens, the thugs flee.

{"_id":"IX0BMZqgv05tWePI","name":"Steinhäger Offices","content":"<p>The Steinhäger family is one of the major merchant houses in the town. It is led by @Actor[Coxv92EfL6VmlpCS]{Franz Steinhäger}, who is also a member of the Inner Council of the Ordo Septenarius. Franz’s brother Heinrich can also be found here, as can Franz’s son Albrecht.</p>\n<p>The only way the Characters can speak to @Actor[Coxv92EfL6VmlpCS]{Franz Steinhäger} is by calling at his @Scene[cQcGoCuumi6JJvpp]{office}. Characters who stop Franz on the streets receive a very unfriendly reaction from him and his two bodyguards.</p>\n<p>Heinrich would be very interested in discovering his brother’s involvement in the Ordo Septenarius and would attempt to use it to discredit his brother and take over the family business. Franz’s son, Albrecht, is aware of his father’s involvement but believes the Ordo Septenarius to be a harmless inner society of the @JournalEntry[hrsJhUcotaRHdmMn]{Merchants' Guild}.</p>\n<p>The offices are in an imposing single-storey building. The family’s badge, a barrel with the letter ‘S’ branded into it, hangs outside. All the rooms in the building are wood-panelled.</p>\n<p>The building contains an office and living quarters for the doorkeeper, a reception room, a conference room, offices for the clerks, and offices for Franz Steinhäger, his son Albrecht, and his brother Heinrich.</p>\n<h4>Watching the Building</h4>\n<p>Staking out the office yields little of interest — merchants and other people come and go throughout the day. Heinrich’s bodyguard calls to collect him just before dusk and the two leave with the rest of the staff at dusk. Franz and Albrecht leave shortly after nightfall, in the company of Franz’s two bodyguards, and return to their house on @JournalEntry[EEGZQJisFqmgyt7P]{The Adel Ring}.</p>\n<h4>An Appointment?</h4>\n<p>A porter guards the offices night and day. During the day Franz, Heinrich, and Albrecht can usually be found here. Also in the building are Franz’s two bodyguards, the Chief Clerk Matthias Wertz, and three junior clerks. At night, all doors are locked, and the building is occupied only by the porter and his dog.</p>\n<p>The Characters cannot gain access to the Steinhäger offices without having some business (real or pretend) that might interest House Steinhäger. Without a good reason to visit, a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Charm </strong>Test is necessary to be shown in by the doorkeeper. The Characters are let into one of the reception rooms, where they are kept waiting for ten minutes. They are then shown in to see @Actor[Coxv92EfL6VmlpCS]{Franz Steinhäger}.</p>\n<p>When the Characters see him, Franz is feeling somewhat disgruntled about the break-in at the Hidden Temple and has no wish to ‘waste time with fools’. He orders the Characters from his office if they mention anything relating to the temple or if they fail any Charm Test. He leaves instructions that the Characters are not to be allowed in to see him again after this.</p>\n<p>During any interview with Franz, the Character with the highest Perception Skill notices the symbol of the Ordo Septenarius on the bottom of a sheet of parchment. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test is required to make out the signature and the visible writing. Franz rapidly covers the letter if he thinks anyone has noticed it. The text of the letter is reproduced here. You should reveal as much or as little as you feel the Character was able to see (taking into account the fact that the Character was reading the note upside-down), and only give @JournalEntry[lZO80wXt0MJThLEM]{Handout 9: All Goes Well} to the Players if the Characters are able to steal the note somehow.</p>\n<h4>Heinrich Steinhäger </h4>\n<p>Having failed to make much progress with Franz, the Characters may decide to talk to Heinrich Steinhäger, Franz’s brother. An appointment can easily be made with him after they have seen Franz, as Heinrich likes to know all that goes on. Alternatively, the Characters may decide to talk to Heinrich as he makes his way home in the evening.</p>\n<p>Heinrich looks similar to Franz, appearing as a younger, brown-haired version (42 years old). Heinrich is jealous of Franz. He wishes to depose him and take over the family business. He is most interested in any evidence that the adventurers can provide of Franz’s involvement in any illegal activities.</p>\n<p>Heinrich should appear to the Characters as the only person in Bögenhafen who believes their tale, but he does so only to further his own ends. Heinrich will lead the Characters on if  possible, he will express shock and disgust at anything they tell him. He is genuinely horrified at talk of a Daemon under the offices. After listening to the Characters and spurring them on about the iniquities of it all, he points out that there is little the authorities can do, largely as the authorities appear to be in league with Franz! </p>\n<p>However, if Franz were to meet with a fatal accident (and accidents will happen!), then not only will Bögenhafen be safe, but the Characters would also be handsomely rewarded. Heinrich is willing to pay @Credit[15gc EACH]{15 GC} to each Character for his brother’s demise, but can be Haggled up to @Credit[20gc EACH]{20 GC}.</p>\n<p>If the Characters do murder Franz, Heinrich is the first to inform on them. Paying all that gold would be a waste of his money, and the Characters are obviously deranged.</p>\n<h4>Breaking In</h4>\n<p>The Characters may try to break into the building at night. The windows are shuttered and locked from inside and all the doors are locked and sturdy @JournalEntry[BRCzUptEKAlTMa6a]{(D −20, SL 4; TB 3, W 10)}. The guard dog has a free run of the courtyard at night. If the Characters make any noise entering the building, the dog hears them on a successful <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test. If so, it begins to bark loudly, waking the porter after [[/gmr 1d10]] Rounds. If the Characters break any of the doors down, the porter inevitably hears that. Once awake, the porter comes to investigate, and once he sees what is going on, he attempts to inform the Watch. A four-man @Actor[nCzNGuS22drsDAIe]{Watch patrol} will arrive in [[/gmr 10 + 1d10]] minutes and attempt to arrest the Characters for burglary.</p>\n<h4>Franz Steinhäger’s Office</h4>\n<p>Hidden behind one of the wooden panels in Franz’s office is a locked door @JournalEntry[BRCzUptEKAlTMa6a]{(D −30, SL 4; TB 5, W 15)} that opens on to a flight of stairs, leading down to a cellar where the @JournalEntry[tPtznffIXCzCxMcm]{Hidden Temple} is situated. The door can only be found with a successful <strong>Difficult (−10) Perception </strong>Test. No one else in the building is aware of its presence.</p>\n<p>The drawer to Steinhäger’s desk is locked @JournalEntry[BRCzUptEKAlTMa6a]{(D −20, SL 6; TB 2, W 4)} and contains a list of Steinhäger warehouses (Nos. 1–7) along with their contents (various inexpensive trade items — cheap wine, timber, and similar goods). Underneath this is a bronze medallion and sheets of parchment, all with the Ordo Septenarius emblem on them. Also, in here is @JournalEntry[lZO80wXt0MJThLEM]{Handout 9: All Goes Well}, the letter that was previously on Steinhäger’s desk.</p>\n<p>If the Characters remove the drawer, they notice a leatherbound book hidden behind it. The book belongs to Teugen and has his name on the front. It is written in Language (Magick) and contains the following Dark Magic Spells: @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.3mZ76XJX38pT2d7r]{Blast (Daemonology)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.iR1C4icHTLBIH2Mk]{Corrosive Blood (Daemonology)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.ovBsMewZzi7r6Ffx]{Dark Vision (Daemonology)}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.pMPYQC15eRIaJ2eL]{Fearsome (Daemonology)}, and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.7wK4srcIgc8USRYt]{Push (Daemonology)}.</p>\n<p>A safe is hidden behind a map of Bögenhafen. It is locked and contains two chests, each individually locked @JournalEntry[BRCzUptEKAlTMa6a]{(D −40, SL 8L; TB 9, W 20)}, each containing @Credit[100gc SPLIT]{100 GC}. Underneath one of the chests is an unsigned note from Teugen to remind Steinhäger that a beggar will be brought into the temple to consecrate it.</p>\n<h4>Heinrich Steinhäger’s Office</h4>\n<p>Heinrich’s desk is not locked. If the Characters look, they will find a letter addressed to a Herr Schultz in Altdorf. The  letter expresses disgust at Franz’s running of the business and bemoans Heinrich’s bad luck at being born two years later than his brother.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Primary Locations (Chasing Shadows)","sort":200001},"cf":{"id":"temp_xzyp7h5zgvb","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 8 - Chasing Shadows#/CF_SEP/Primary Locations (Chasing Shadows)","color":"#000000"}}}

Three coaches are staying overnight, so the inn is crowded. It will be a quiet stopover unless the Characters wish to interact with the clientele, none of whom are particularly interesting unless you choose otherwise. Any NPC may reveal any of the available @JournalEntry[BNkMTQoBWvkHNgOn]{rumours}, but generally this should be a quiet place to spend the night and the journey should continue with no problem in the morning. However, the coachmen will drink heavily as before — or even more heavily, given the day they just had — and they may well be just as hungover the next morning.</p>\n<p>At the inn, @Actor[goVesadmHWsl5E98]{Lady Isolde}, @Actor[s3C4siPuECgh14Vl]{Janna}, and @Actor[LBc3rDFHm6j2rI6C]{Marie} leave the coach and book seats on a Four Seasons coach that departs for the capital in the morning.

{"_id":"KbDXwgwhLNgf0gVO","name":"Town Hall (Chasing Shadows)","content":"<p>At the @JournalEntry[UCK3MzI2bCugyPHz]{Town Hall}, the Characters are met by a surly-looking clerk, Mehralmann Arbeitwert. If asked, he informs them that the Goblin was killed in a warehouse the previous night. Since they failed to capture it, the Town Council is not prepared to pay any money for their part in the proceedings.</p>\n<p>The Characters may attempt to persuade the clerk to pay them. On a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Charm</strong> Test (don’t forget any Fellowship modifiers if they have not cleaned up first!) the clerk tells them to wait, and disappears into one of the inner rooms for [[/gmr 2d10 * 10]] minutes. </p>\n<p>If the Characters are still around when he comes back, he says that he has been authorised to cover their accommodation expenses, and gives them @Credit[10ss EACH]{10/–} each. This sum is not negotiable, and further bargaining attempts do not increase it.</p>\n<p>The clerk does not know anything more about the fate of the Goblin and refuses to find out for the Characters: ‘<em>Ain’t nuffin to do wiv me.</em>’ If the Characters ask to see @Actor[P3HlNMK6rubzDoxM]{Magistrate Richter}, or anyone else in authority, they are directed to the @JournalEntry[kahbAL4tUYjxkbCp]{Festival Court}.</p>\n<p>If the Characters attempt to impress Arbeitwert with tales of monsters in the sewers, they are treated with open scorn. Adventuring folk are known for their tall tales, and the clerk assumes the Characters are fishing for some kind of official commission to clear these alleged monsters from the sewers.</p>\n<p>If the Characters mention the Hidden Temple, the clerk takes down any particulars they care to give him. Arbeitwert is sceptical and scathing of their find and only enters a partial account of it into the record. He believes the Characters are lying and says so in the report. After filling in the report, the clerk leaves and keeps them waiting for [[/gmr 1d10 + 10]] minutes while he tries to establish who should deal with the report. At the end of this time he asks the Characters to call back the following day. </p>\n<h4>The Following Day</h4>\n<p>The clerk ignores them for ten minutes as he writes in a ledger. When he eventually looks up, he says, ‘<em>The Council thanks you for your help. Your allegations are being looked into. Good day</em>.’ He returns to his ledger and is reluctant to speak to the Characters any further. Teugen has instructed him to assure the party that the authorities are looking into the matter, and to discourage it from investigating further. If Steinhäger is mentioned, the clerk suggests that it is not a good idea for outsiders to slander prominent town councillors.</p>\n<p>If the Characters insist on talking to someone in authority, successful use of Charm or Intimidate sends Arbeitwert scurrying away. He returns another [[/gmr 10 + 2d10]] minutes later and ushers the group into an office, saying that Councillor Teugen has kindly consented to see them.</p>\n<h4>Councillor Teugen</h4>\n<p>The Characters follow the clerk along a wood-panelled corridor to a stout oak door with a nameplate marked ‘Councillor Teugen’. After knocking, the clerk waves the party into the gloom beyond.</p>\n<p>Entering or peering into the room, the Characters see the curtains are drawn, leaving the office dark. Councillor @Actor[LG5qATEIFPE9bezB]{Johannes Teugen} sits behind a large mahogany desk. Until the Characters’ eyes adjust to the half-light, all they can see is his large form silhouetted against the closed curtains. </p>\n<p>Teugen greets them pleasantly. ‘<em>Good day. Please come in and close the door behind you. My apologies for the darkness, but I have a terrible headache</em>.’ Teugen motions to chairs by his desk.</p>\n<p>As the Characters sit down, Teugen reaches for a goblet of dark-red liquid with a white, pasty hand. As he raises the goblet to his lips, a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test notes that Teugen’s eye-teeth are rather long and pointed. A gold chain bearing a medallion with his family’s crest hangs around his neck.</p>\n<p>Despite appearances, Teugen is not a Vampire. He is drinking wine, and his pale skin and sharp teeth have arisen from his years of dabbling with corrupting dhar. You can encourage the Characters to embarrass themselves by brandishing holy hammers and blessed water or ripping open the curtains, or the matter can be downplayed as Teugen offers them wine from the same decanter he used to fill his own goblet.</p>\n<p>It is Teugen’s intention to convince the Characters that their concerns are being investigated and that they need not concern themselves any more with this matter. Surely, they trust the @JournalEntry[PTKD6ENtfGitpZ9w]{Town Council} to take care of this affair?</p>\n<p>In a pleasant manner, Teugen repeats what the clerk has already said. He explains the reward was conditional on recovery of the Goblin, which they failed to do. If the party mentions the Hidden Temple, or any other sewer discoveries, Teugen smiles in a faintly patronising manner (revealing his teeth again), and explains that it is a common practice for householders to maintain private shrines in their cellars.</p>\n<p>As for a Daemon? Well, that is obviously ridiculous. Teugen is sure the Characters were simply deceived by tricks of the light and distorted echoes in the sewers’ dismal environment.</p>\n<p>If the Ordo Septenarius is mentioned, Teugen explains that he is indeed a member of the charitable institution. He says, somewhat apologetically, that he does not have time to talk about it now. He recommends the Characters see @Actor[7rE1jYAeMNKfrgcQ]{Councillor Magirius} at the @JournalEntry[hrsJhUcotaRHdmMn]{Merchants' Guild}, who, he is sure, will be happy to answer any questions.</p>\n<p>He then excuses himself as he has much to do, and rings a small brass bell that stands on his desk. The clerk appears to show the party out.</p>\n<p>On future visits to the Town Hall, the Characters are unable to get past the clerk. If they are insistent, four members of the Watch appear to escort them from the building.</p>\n<h4>The Town Records</h4>\n<p>The town records, which are stored in the Town Hall, are not available to the Characters. Teugen uses his influence to restrict access to members of the Town Council only, and all attempts to complain about this are rebuffed.</p>\n<h4>Watching the Town Hall</h4>\n<p>Various people come and go throughout the day, and most of the staff leave just before dusk. Teugen always leaves at the same time after dusk and goes directly to his house on @JournalEntry[EEGZQJisFqmgyt7P]{The Adel Ring}.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Primary Locations (Chasing Shadows)","sort":1300001},"cf":{"id":"temp_xzyp7h5zgvb","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 8 - Chasing Shadows#/CF_SEP/Primary Locations (Chasing Shadows)","color":"#000000"}}}
{"_id":"KhZATo01yHl3YsLj","name":"The Guilds (Chasing Shadows)","content":"<p>There are several guilds the Characters may have reason to visit as they investigate what’s happening in Bögenhafen. During the course of their enquiries into the guilds, should any Character need to make a Fellowship-based Test, the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette (Guilder)} Talent makes the Test 1 step easier.</p>\n<h4>The Stevedores’ Guild</h4>\n<p>Calling at the @JournalEntry[KoTTFOzxJmVi6EPe]{Stevedores' Guild}, the Characters are met by Gurney Dumkopf, a huge hulking man who runs the guild. Gurney knows who his true friends are, and does not betray Teugen. The merchant paid good money for pressure to be put on the Characters, and has always been a good employer in the past. How Gurney reacts depends on whether the Characters succeed in a <strong>Challenging (+0) Charm</strong> Test or not (Characters in the Stevedore Career gain a bonus of +20 to this Test). If they do, he is friendly and jovial, but will not expose Teugen. Should the Characters get too pushy, eight thugs appear from a back room and Gurney asks the adventurers to leave, smiling as he does so. If the Test is failed, Gurney tells them, ‘<em>Get lost if you don't want to get hurt</em>’. Refusing to comply with his request results in an attack from the eight thugs.</p>\n<h4>The Metalworkers’ Guild</h4>\n<p>A successful <strong>Average (+20) Charm</strong> Test here will reveal that the @JournalEntry[YmYe0Mfo4sxW560Q]{Metalworkers' Guild} was requested to make a ring of pure copper, 15ft in diameter. It was fashioned for Teugen about two years ago, not long after he first arrived from Nuln. He claimed it was something he would use in his studies.</p>\n<h4>The Physicians’ Guild</h4>\n<p>Presumably enquiring about @Actor[P3HlNMK6rubzDoxM]{Magistrate Richter’s} health or the demise of Teugen’s brother, the Characters are shown in to see Reinhold Heichtdorn, guildmaster of the @JournalEntry[wRgn4m4kMEn1ZHfa]{Physicians' Guild}. Heichtdorn is a busy man and quickly throws the Characters out unless they can impress him. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Charm </strong>Test secures begrudging help. An <strong>Average (+20) Lore (Medicine) </strong>Test is better, as Heichtdorn likes talking shop. Finally, if the Character can provide Heichtdorn with a complete diagnosis of Richter’s disease, the guildmaster is very impressed. If given information as to the required treatment, Heichtdorn promises to arrange it. If treated correctly, the magistrate continues to be delirious for a week, after which time the symptoms slowly recede and he will be fit and well after a further three weeks.</p>\n<p>If he is impressed with the Characters, Heichtdorn tells them that he has seen this disease before: when Karl Teugen died two years ago. If the Characters have not been able to diagnose the disease and recommend appropriate treatment, Heichtdorn confesses to being stumped and seeing no hope for Richter’s recovery. He expects the Magistrate will die within the week, by which time he will have turned purple and his tongue will be so swollen it will fill his whole mouth.</p>\n<h4>The Mourners’ Guild</h4>\n<p>At the @JournalEntry[vqgbqnSnKTt6niQk]{Mourners' Guild}, a successful <strong>Average (+20) Gossip </strong>Test (cultists of Morr gain a bonus of +20 to this Test) reveals that there has been an unusually high number of paupers’ burials in the last few months. The deceased are generally beggars and are often severely mutilated and sometimes missing vital organs — often the heart. Enquiries about Karl Teugen elicit the following response:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘A lovely rich purple he was when he came in, and his tongue was deep and red, and stuck right out of his mouth. And his eyes were huge — like eggs, they were. It took us two days to make him respectable; we were lucky ’cause we had a dead beggar at the time so we weren’t short o’ bits to pretty ’im up.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>The Merchants’ Guild</h4>\n<p>The @JournalEntry[hrsJhUcotaRHdmMn]{Merchants' Guild} has a clerk sitting at a front desk carved with imperial crosses and coins. A successful <strong>Average (+0) Gossip</strong> Test provides information about the primary @JournalEntry[RuqDBFEu6BTWCKLw]{Merchant Houses} in Bögenhafen. Difficulty modifiers should be imposed according to the appearance and behaviour of the Characters. For example, lower-class characters find the Test 1 step harder, while those dressed as merchants find it 1 step easier.</p>\n<p>If the Characters ask after the Ordo Septenarius, they are asked to wait. After 15 minutes, they are shown to see @Actor[7rE1jYAeMNKfrgcQ]{Friedrich Magirius}, the guildmaster. </p>\n<p>He stands up as the Characters enter, introduces himself, and asks them to sit. Magirius then enquires politely what the Characters’ interest in the Ordo Septenarius might be, and listens to any story they care to tell him. Magirius gives no indication of whether or not he believes what he is told. When the Characters finish their tale, Magirius stands up, still smiling.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘It seems to me that this is no more than an unfortunate series of misunderstandings. If you will do me the honour of dining with me, I'll explain the whole business to you. I can assure you that there is nothing sinister about this at all.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the Characters are willing, Magirius then takes them to the @JournalEntry[8Z5QurZdHl5j6u9N]{Golden Trout Club}; if not he looks disappointed and refuses to talk any more, simply wishing them a good day. You should make it clear to the Characters that they have clearly insulted Magirius by refusing his offer. Should they reconsider, Magirius gladly takes them to the Golden Trout, otherwise he shows them out.</p>\n<p>Should the Characters ever stake out the Merchants’ Guild, various people come and go throughout the day, but no one of particular interest. Towards dusk, Magirius leaves the Guild along with most of the other people working there, and goes to his house on @JournalEntry[OkpN8708mk93iVYZ]{The Adel Ring}.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Primary Locations (Chasing Shadows)","sort":700001},"cf":{"id":"temp_xzyp7h5zgvb","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 8 - Chasing Shadows#/CF_SEP/Primary Locations (Chasing Shadows)","color":"#000000"}}}
{"_id":"LEC9zpqx0a26mn6z","name":"Bad Moon Rising","content":"<p>Two moons orbit the Warhammer world: Morrslieb and Mannslieb. Morrslieb, the smaller of the moons, is also known as ‘the Chaos moon’, and is composed entirely of Warpstone that was thrown into the sky following a catastrophe in the unfathomably distant past. The moon has an erratic orbit, sometimes close, sometimes far, and is known to react to the activities of the Ruinous Powers. As the Chaos god Tzeentch and its minions prepare to destroy Bögenhafen to create a Chaos Gate in the midst of the Empire, Morrslieb goes through many changes that can be seen from the ground. The following events are entirely optional. You may find them useful in creating a sense of impending cosmic doom, but you may also find them a little too theatrical.</p>\n<h3>Day 1</h3>\n<p>Morrslieb rises full. This is universally known as a bad omen. The folk of Bögenhafen look to the sky in distress as the small moon bathes the town in sickly green light.</p>\n<h3>Day 2</h3>\n<p>On the second night, Morrslieb is again full and also significantly larger than normal. It almost appears to stop above the town, not orbiting like normal. As the night progresses, a grinning skull appears on the moon. It is indistinct at first, but has unmistakable features by dawn. To many inhabitants of Bögenhafen, the moon’s face seems odd but is of no great cause for concern — it’s certainly not the first time it’s happened. For others, it’s disturbing. Some refuse to leave their houses at night, whilst other take to the streets to claim the end is nigh!</p>\n<h3>Day 3</h3>\n<p>When Morrslieb appears on the third night, it is even larger and the skull face more pronounced. It seems to hang low above the town, and in any reflections (in pools, puddles, glass, and similar), it appears impossibly close, as if it were scraping the tallest buildings. As the night progresses, the skull face sometimes appears to move. </p>\n<p>Occasionally, in reflections, some folk swear they see the moon licking its lips with a huge, green tongue. Many hide away in fear at this, but a few treat it as a spectacle to be witnessed, and stand outside watching the swollen moon, hoping to catch sight of something extraordinary. Those staying outside for longer than half an hour in this moonlight have to Test for a @Corruption[minor]{Minor Exposure to Corruption}.</p>\n<h3>Day 4 and Beyond</h3>\n<p>If the adventure continues for more than three days, the moon continues to stare at the town, casting its foul light everywhere, which continues to be a Minor Exposure to Corruption. If Teugen’s ceremony is stopped, an expression of disappointment crosses the moon’s face and it shrinks visibly over the course </p>\n<p>of the night until it has become a tiny, green crescent in the </p>\n<p>sky once more. If the ceremony is completed and a Chaos Gate is opened, the moon’s mouth widens into a silent howl of triumph. It stays in this happy skull form, massive and full above Bögenhafen, until the Chaos Gate is closed. Further, it now acts as a source of @Corruption[moderate]{Moderate Exposure to Corruption} to all potential targets within 99 miles of Bögenhafen, and it only takes 10 minutes for this to take effect. Mutation spreads quickly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note: </strong>Don't forget to use the Morrslieb Filter!

Assuming they are attending with Magirius, they are welcomed at the door by the porter, and Magirius leads the Characters to the dining room. He then invites them to sit and order whatever they like from the club’s extensive menu. </p>\n<p>He makes polite but irrelevant conversation over the meal, talking about the wool and wine trades, asking the Characters for their impressions of the town and the Schaffenfest, where they are from, and similar small talk. Magirius politely but firmly steers conversation away from any discussion of the Hidden Temple and the Ordo Septenarius, saying that he is happy to explain everything after the meal.</p>\n<p>Once the meal is over, Magirius orders a decanter of brandy and begins to explain the society. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘I can see how this series of misunderstandings has arisen. I suppose it’s only natural, since we prefer to keep the society’s undertakings confidential. </p>\n<p>‘The Ordo Septenarius is a club, if you like, and most of the members are drawn from the merchant families of the town. There are 49 members in all — 42 ordinary members and an Inner Council of 7. </p>\n<p>‘We represent the elite within the Merchants’ Guild, and co-operate with each other in order to reap the greatest profit for all. We make donations to the temples, and run a soup kitchen in the Pit for the relief of the poor in association with the Temple of Shallya.</p>\n<p>‘There are various reasons why we prefer to remain nameless — many of our members are town councillors, like myself, and many more are in a position to stand for office if they choose. People in those positions would be open to accusations of bribery and electioneering if they were to engage in these charitable activities openly, and it would be a shame if the poor were to suffer because we were afraid to do anything for them.</p>\n<p>‘Also, our co-operation in mercantile ventures is bound to incite a certain amount of bad feeling amongst our competitors. As things are, people are aware that some cooperation is going on, but they don't know who is involved; thus, they cannot openly accuse any individual of malpractice or take any reprisals. And their suspicions tend to work against them, giving us an even greater advantage.</p>\n<p>‘So, you understand our need for secrecy. There are many who would reap great political advantage by discovering the membership of the Ordo, and some of our junior members might be tempted by their offers. We need to offer them some... encouragement to abide by the rules of the society. Because of this the workings of the Ordo are wrapped in a certain amount of ritual — or, should I say, the semblance of ritual, with various ceremonies, oaths, and grades of initiation. I find that nothing concentrates the mind on thoughts of allegiance like participation in ceremony and the promise of promotion.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Throughout the conversation, Magirius dismisses talk of daemonic presences in the sewers and the terrible rites that must accompany them. He firmly believes that there is nothing evil about the Ordo and seeks to impress this on the Characters. </p>\n<p>If the Hidden Temple is mentioned, he explains that it is no more than a meeting room, devised by @Actor[LG5qATEIFPE9bezB]{Councillor Teugen} to impress the lesser members of the Ordo, and is really not something to worry about. He snorts at any mention of a Daemon, and passes off such experiences as tricks of the light and the Characters’ overactive imaginations. After all, he has been in the cellar, and everything seemed fine to him when he was last there.</p>\n<p>Magirius does not answer any questions about the membership of the Ordo Septenarius, nor divulge any further information about the society. If the Characters press the point, he tells them that he has already given them a complete explanation — which he was under no compulsion to do — and repeats that the society requires a certain amount of secrecy, which he may already have compromised.</p>\n<p>The meal over, Magirius leaves the Characters outside the Golden Trout and returns to his @JournalEntry[hrsJhUcotaRHdmMn]{guildhall}. There he leaves instructions that he is not to be disturbed again by the Characters, no matter the urgency.</p>\n<p>Once the Characters have left the Golden Trout with Magirius, they are not readmitted to the exclusive club unless they are the guests of another member of the club. </p>\n<p>The Characters will not be able to question any of the staff unless they are particularly persistent and approach them outside the Trout. However, the staff know little of the affairs of the club’s members, and what they do know is treated in the utmost confidence.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Primary Locations (Chasing Shadows)","sort":600001},"cf":{"id":"temp_xzyp7h5zgvb","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 8 - Chasing Shadows#/CF_SEP/Primary Locations (Chasing Shadows)","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"NPx2lo9NcPxYpNFL","name":"Options: Recasting Gideon","content":"<p>For Grognard players, the inclusion of Gideon comes as no surprise. The obvious choice to subvert this expectation would be to have Gideon posing as someone else. Perhaps as Magirius, or Steinhäger, or even Richter, and have the Daemon work to the same end goal using a different form. A less obvious alternative would be to recast Gideon completely, perhaps as one of the most powerful Daemons from the Realms of Chaos…</p>\n<h3>The Changeling</h3>\n<p>Instead of Gideon being a Herald of Tzeentch sent by a Greater Daemon to further its plans in the Reikland, it is actually the Changeling.</p>\n<p>The Changeling is an infamous Daemon that even the gods fear. It’s the embodiment of Tzeentch’s meddling psyche: a deceiver, a trickster, and an inveterate prankster. Most importantly, it can mirror the form of any entity completely, adopting mannerisms flawlessly, becoming others so perfectly that even the Dark Gods themselves are fooled. It is said there is only one form the Changeling cannot take, and that is Tzeentch itself.</p>\n<p>The Changeling is known for meddling with events of extraordinary significance. The opening of a rift into the Realms of Chaos in the heart of the Empire is exactly the sort of challenge it relishes.</p>\n<p>The impact of using the Changeling is relatively small until the very end. Gideon still shapeshifts, Teugen still aims to perform the ritual, and the Ordo are still in his thrall. But, come the climax, the Changeling reacts very differently to a mere Herald.</p>\n<p>If the ritual is disrupted, the Changeling is unfazed. The Daemon, amused to be defeated, sheds its Gideon pretence and appears as a floating, cowled figure, its head hidden in shadow, its four gangly blue limbs wreathed in magic. It bows to the Characters, then the unblinking Eye in the copper circle, and then dances free, reshaping itself as required to withdraw, perhaps as a watchman, a noble, or as a crow, or maybe even one of the Characters. The party, no matter how resourceful, will not catch up with it. For the moment, it is gone.</p>\n<p>If the ritual is completed, Gideon no longer enters the pit with glee. Instead, it backs away slowly and begins to laugh, menacingly and with many voices. The Changeling then advises the Characters to flee if they have not done so already. ‘<em>FOR HOW CAN YOU FIGHT IF YOU ARE DEAD</em>?’ It then makes its own escape. It has no desire to have an audience with one of Tzeentch’s Greater Daemons. The last time the Changeling drew close to Tzeentch, it brought a gift of hair that it tricked from the sublime head of Slaanesh, but this time it has no offering, and an offering will be expected. The Changeling leaves to resolve this before it is noticed by the incoming Daemon.</p>\n<p>If you do decide to make Gideon the Changeling, this option is discussed further in the Empire in Ruins Companion, where the Changeling’s potential impact on the end of the campaign is explored in more detail.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-eis/assets/other/grognard3.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 9 - The Darkest Hour","sort":600000},"cf":{"id":"temp_n709dapcyhd","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 9 - The Darkest Hour","color":"#5e2522"}}}

If the Characters have the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette (Servants)} Talent, they gain a bonus of +20 to this Test. If successful, the Characters learn the information given under @JournalEntry[RuqDBFEu6BTWCKLw]{Merchant Houses} for each house they visit.

This happens regardless of the results of any Gossip or other Test as Magirius has left instructions that anyone enquiring about the society is to be sent to him immediately.</p>\n<h4>The Teugen House</h4>\n<p>The Teugen House is set back from the road in its own grounds. The walls around the grounds are 15ft high and stone. It requires a successful <strong>Impossible (−50) Climb</strong> Test to cross the wall (remember the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.MGEPI4jNhymNIRVz]{Scale Sheer Surface} Talent will negate the Difficulty, and climbing equipment could also help). The gates are also 15ft high, but can be climbed with a successful <strong>Average (+20) Climb</strong> Test. During the day, the gates are open and visitors can call at the house. At night the gates are locked @JournalEntry[BRCzUptEKAlTMa6a]{(D −10, SL 5)} and three guard dogs roam the grounds. There are always four bodyguards at the house to deal with any intruders.</p>\n<p>Any nighttime incursions into the grounds attract the dogs, who bark and rush to attack. The Characters have time to run back to the walls before the dogs arrive, but if a Character has a lower Agility than the Dogs, one attacks as the Character climbs back over the wall. If the Character suffers any Wounds, the Dog bites deep and tries to drag the Character down. Perform an <strong>Opposed Strength</strong> Test. If the dog wins, he drags the Character off the wall for a 2 yard fall; otherwise the Character can make an escape.</p>\n<p>If the Characters are still in the grounds, the bodyguards rush in a Round later, drawn by the dogs’ barking. Any Character caught by the guards is thrown out of the main gate after a good beating, with a stern warning not to come back. If the bodyguards cannot subdue any Characters within 5 Rounds, six club -wielding servants from the house reinforce them. </p>\n<p>Anyone caught a second time by the bodyguards is handed over to the Watch to be charged with attempted robbery and assault.</p>\n<p>There is little to be gained from simply watching the house.

If both of these conditions are met, the adventurers receive a letter in return, asking them to call at the Ruggbroder House that evening.</p>\n<p>Arriving at the house, the Characters are shown in to meet Heironymus Ruggbroder. Heironymus is deeply troubled by the existence of the Ordo, and fears that it is out to destroy him and his family. He knows of the involvement of @Actor[LG5qATEIFPE9bezB]{Teugen}, @Actor[Coxv92EfL6VmlpCS]{Franz Steinhäger}, and @Actor[7rE1jYAeMNKfrgcQ]{Friedrich Magirius}, and he is interested in any additional information the Characters may have.

He will offer @Credit[5gc SPLIT]{5 GC}for information and promise @Credit[25gc SPLIT]{25 GC} for conclusive evidence.</p>\n<p>Ruggbroder uses any evidence provided by the Characters to discredit those families involved. He lays any evidence in front of @Actor[KfVnMx7Bn1DWErM6]{Graf von Saponatheim} in @Scene[RQQBIZT9OyHMFL27]{Castle Grauenberg}.

For us, at least.’</em></p>\n<p><em>‘</em><em>Now you see,</em><em>’ </em>Baumann continues<em>, ‘we have something of a problem. That door you found may not be much to look at, but we like it. It’s funny how you can become attached to things. Call us selfish if you like, but we’re really quite possessive. We don’t really want to share it with anyone. If people keep wandering in and out of it willy-nilly... well, it will just wear out, won’t it? And that would be a shame. In fact, we’d be quite upset.</em></p>\n<p><em>‘So, we’re not quite sure what to do. My two associates here tell me they’d like to beat you to a pulp and drop you in the sewers with a  bag of bricks round your neck. But that wouldn’t be very nice. They do tend to get excitable when they’re upset about something. I’m sure you’ll understand and forgive them, won’t you?</em></p>\n<p><em>‘“No,” I said to myself when I saw your faces. “These people are reasonable. I’m sure they’ll understand.” So, I’m going to ask you to look on it as our little secret. You can keep a secret, can’t you? I’m sure you can. And I have great confidence in my judgement. I get that from my mother, you know. She was very gifted in that direction. </em></p>\n<p><em>So, I’d be very disappointed if I turned out to be wrong, and so would my two friends here. And all of our other friends. We’re very lucky people, you know: we’ve got lots of friends. I suppose we’re just naturally sociable.</em></p>\n<p><em>‘Now, will you promise to keep our little secret? Just for me? It would make me very happy if you promise.’</em></p>\n<p>The Characters have very little choice here. If they refuse to cooperate they are indeed beaten to a pulp and dropped in the sewers attached to bags of bricks. If the Characters agree to keep quiet about the door, Baumann congratulates them on their wise decision, pointing out that he knew all along that they could be trusted and that he wouldn’t do this for just anybody.</p>\n<p>Then, the Characters are led back into the sewers, where they find their weapons in a bundle a little way down the walkway. As the door is shut behind them, Baumann calls after the Characters that his friends will be keeping an eye out, and that they have ‘<em>nasty, suspicious natures, you see</em>’, and that they ‘<em>hate to be disappointed</em>’. With that, the door closes, and a series of scraping sounds are heard from behind it as crates are moved to block the doorway and ensure the Characters cannot regain entry.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Primary Locations (Sewer)","sort":200001},"cf":{"id":"temp_vd68vepu4h9","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 7 - Into The Darkness#/CF_SEP/Primary Locations (Sewer)","color":"#000000"}}}
{"_id":"PkjDAzcaRdRpFRMW","name":"Iniciando Campaña Enemigo Interior","content":"<h3>El Glorioso Imperio</h3>\n<p>El Imperio es el mayor y más poderoso reino del Viejo Mundo. Sus vastos territorios se extienden desde las verdes praderas bretonianas en el oeste a las áridas estepas de Kislev en el este, y desde el helado Mar de las Garras en el norte hasta las altas Montañas Negras en el sur. Es una tierra cubierta de densos bosques y rodeada de cordilleras montañosas, todas ellas infestadas de bandidos, asesinos, horribles mutantes y hambrientos monstruos. El Imperio es una tierra sumida en el miedo y la ignorancia, un lugar donde los caminos forestales están plagados de vándalos, salteadores y cosas aún peores. En la campiña, las apartadas aldeas parecen islas abandonadas entre un auténtico mar de bosques amenazantes. En los pueblos más pequeños cunde la superstición, ¿quién puede negar con seguridad que los rituales de estos lugareños no funcionan contra los peligros que acechan en la oscuridad? Incluso en el Imperio, el más poderoso de los reinos humanos, deambulan los males más insondables y terribles.</p>\n<h3>El Reikland</h3>\n<p>El Emperador Karl Franz I gobierna desde la capital del Gran principado de Reikland, la provincia más grande e importante del imperio, Altdorf, que es a su vez la capital imperial, aunque el verdadero poder del Imperio está en manos de los Electores. Para complicar las cosas, el Emperador es un Elector por derecho propio. Los Electores son los gobernantes de reinos poderosos o religiones poderosas dentro del Imperio. Aun así, el poder que guardan con más celo es el derecho a elegir sucesor cuando un Emperador muere. Una elección es un asunto muy delicado, ya que cada Elector presenta a un candidato que promueva sus intereses personales, en algunos casos poco más que una marioneta. A pesar de esta politiquería, han salido elegidos algunos Emperadores grandes de verdad. Un número igual de ellos han sido candidatos de compromiso, personas de una capacidad modesta cuya cualidad principal era ser inofensivos. Como la historia demuestra, hay mucha rivalidad entre los Condes Electores de las grandes provincias. Del mismo modo, hay una disputa entre los dos cultos religiosos con votos electorales: el Culto de Sigmar y el Culto de Ulric. El Culto de Sigmar tiene su sede en Altdorf y es poderoso en el sur. El Culto de Ulric la tiene en Middenheim y es popular en el norte. Se puede decir que el Gran Teogonista Yorri XV del Culto de Sigmar inclinó la balanza a su favor al conseguir que nombraran Electores a dos de sus subordinados, mientras que el Culto de Ulric está representado sólo por el Ar-Ulric, un título que significa 'Hijo de Ulric'. Aunque los Electores pasan gran parte del tiempo compitiendo por una posición, a menudo muestran un frente unido ante el Emperador, las poblaciones independientes y los gremios, a quienes quieren controlar en la medida de lo posible. Como el poder de un Elector deriva del señorío de una gran provincia, el título es hereditario.</p>\n<h3>Las Provincias Electorales</h3>\n<p>Son los reinos dentro del Imperio, cuyos gobernantes son responsables de elegir a un nuevo Emperador cuando el actual muere o abdica. Históricamente, hay una considerable rivalidad y tensión entre las Provincias Electorales. Por suerte para la unidad del Imperio, estas ambiciones se han suprimido en las últimas décadas. El recuerdo de siglos de dura guerra civil asegura que la mayoría de maquinaciones políticas se lleven a cabo discretamente. Los gobernantes de las Provincias Electorales son, de hecho, soberanos en sus propios reinos, lo que significa que son capaces de ejercer su autoridad como crean conveniente dentro de los límites de sus dominios sin necesidad de pedir permiso al Emperador. Algunos son más independientes que otros, gracias a los privilegios especiales otorgados por los anteriores Emperadores. Por ejemplo, las ciudades estado de Middenheim y Talabheim no pagan impuestos a las arcas imperiales y sólo tienen que proporcionar tropas en tiempo de guerra, cuando todas las demás provincias se han agotado. El estilo de gobierno también varía entre las provincias electorales. Talabecland, por ejemplo, es una autocracia muy rígida, mientras que Sudenland tiene muchas instituciones democráticas. Sin embargo, estas variaciones suelen importar poco para el ciudadano medio del Imperio. Tanto da dónde vayas, los ricos siguen siendo ricos y los pobres hacen todo el trabajo. Todas las Provincias Electorales las gobiernan Condes Electores o Electores.</p>\n<p><strong>LAS PROVINCIAS ELECTORALES ACTUALES</strong></p>\n<p>En el año 2512 las provincias electorales son:</p>\n<p>•<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Gran Condado de Averland</p>\n<p>•<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Gran Ducado de Middenheim</p>\n<p>•<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Gran Ducado de Middenland</p>\n<p>•<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Gran Condado de Mootland</p>\n<p>•<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Gran Condado de Nuln</p>\n<p>•<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Gran Principado de Ostland</p>\n<p>•<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Gran Principado de Reikland</p>\n<p>•<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Gran Condado de Stirland</p>\n<p>•<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Gran Baronía de Sudenland</p>\n<p>•<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Gran Ducado de Talabheim</p>\n<p>•<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Gran Ducado de Talabecland</p>\n<h3>Actualmente</h3>\n<p>En el día <strong>25 de Novanio del año Imperial de 2512</strong> nuestra heterogénea banda de héroes se encuentra camino de Altdorf por carretera, a punto de llegar a la posada de <em>La Diligencia y los caballos</em>....</p>\n<p> </p>","img":"504px-TheEnemyWithinJohnBlanche.jpg","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.yJexMlvunnfAzlMD"},"wfrp4e-starter-set":{"sort":100001},"cf":{"id":"temp_3rf4tb5n579","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Introducción","color":"#185b72"}}}

It is orbited by two moons. The larger of these (known in the Empire as Mannslieb, ‘Beloved of Manann’) has a cycle of 25 days from full to full, and looks not unlike the moon of our own world. The other (named Morrslieb, ‘Beloved of Morr’ ) is erratic, appearing now closer, now further away, and has an unpredictable cycle. Ancient myth has it that when Chaos first broke through into the Known World, an enormous chunk of warpstone was hurled high into the sky, where it circles endlessly to this day, spreading Chaos on the lands over which it passes. True or not, the followers of Chaos hold festivals when Morrslieb is full.</p>\n<p>The Imperial Calendar divides the year’s 400 days into 12 months with 6 additional intercalary days. Four of these betweenmonth days are festivals that mark the turning of the seasons: the summer and winter solstices, and the spring and autumn equinoxes. The other two mark the days when both moons are always full at the same time: and the superstitious, and even the cynical, avoid the eerie light of the two moons on Hexensnacht (‘Witching Night’) and Geheimnisnacht (‘Night of Mystery’).</p>\n<h3>Days</h3>\n<p>The days of the week are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wellentag (VELL’n-taag): ‘Workday’</li>\n<li>Aubentag (OW-ben-taag): ‘Levy Day’</li>\n<li>Marktag (MARK-taag): ‘Market Day’</li>\n<li>Backertag (BAKKER-taag): ‘Baking Day’</li>\n<li>Bezahltag (b’TZAAL-taag): ‘Tax Day’</li>\n<li>Konistag (KO-nis-taag): ‘King Day’</li>\n<li>Angestag (AN-ges-taag): ‘Start Day’</li>\n<li>Festag (FESS-taag): ‘Holiday’<br /><br /></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Months</h3>\n<p>The names of the months, and their meanings, are as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nachhexen (Nach-HEX’n): ‘After-Witching’</li>\n<li>Jahrdrung (YAAR-drung): ‘Year-Turn’</li>\n<li>Pflugzeit (pFLOOG-tsight): ‘Plough-Tide’</li>\n<li>Sigmarzeit (ZIGG-mar-tsight): ‘Sigmar-Tide’</li>\n<li>Sommerzeit (ZOMMER-tsight): ‘Summer-Time’</li>\n<li>Vorgeheim (FORR-g’hime): ‘Before Mystery’</li>\n<li>Nachgeheim (NACH-g’hime): ‘After Mystery’</li>\n<li>Erntezeit (ERN-t’sight): ‘Harvest Time’</li>\n<li>Brauzeit (BRAOW-tsight): ‘Brewing Time’</li>\n<li>Kaldezeit (KAL-tsight): ‘Cold Time’</li>\n<li>Ulriczeit (UL-rik-tsight): ‘Ulric-Tide’</li>\n<li>Vorhexen (FORR-hex’n): ‘Before Witching’<br /><br /><br /></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>The Harmony of the Spheres</em></h3>\n<p>‘They came in their silvery ships.

If they protest about this, the innkeeper explains that the escaped Goblin was caught and killed in a warehouse on the docks, about an hour after they entered the sewers.

{"_id":"SKwNG1pvWxXlGr0B","name":"The Journey To Weissbruck","content":"<p>The trip to Bögenhafen involves travelling the full length of @JournalEntry[MBMhy4NrPeACDEYl]{The Weissbruck Canal}<span style=\"white-space:nowrap;background-color:rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.05)\"> </span>from outside Altdorf to Weissbruck, where it joins the @JournalEntry[2fe0ux3fDMtoiHZK]{River Bögen}. Josef guides the barge into the great lock at the entrance of the canal by the quiet village of Lethov on the very edge of the @JournalEntry[fZKynnyBSGStMXEQ]{Altdorf Flats}. Here the toll of 2 GC is paid and the barge passes through to the canal itself.</p>\n<h3>The Weissbruck Canal</h3>\n<p>The 60-mile Weissbruck Canal was completed in 2462 IC to carry coal and iron from the mines at Delfgruber directly to Altdorf, avoiding the heavy tolls in Carroburg. Originally designed to accomodate narrow barges towed by horses, the owners have since opened the canal to barges of all kinds to increase toll revenues. However, as the canal is only 25ft wide at its narrowest point, and given the average Reik barge is some 23ft wide, the canal is far too thin for two larger barges to pass side-by-side. To remedy this, an expensive refit began 20 years ago to widen the canal to at least 50ft in key sections to provide ‘passing places’. It was already this wide by the berthing points and locks, but these were too infrequent to ensure jams were not a daily occurrence. </p>\n<p>Today, all the original berthing points have inns adjacent, which are broadly similar in layout to the Coach and Horses Inn. House Gruber of Weissbruck manages the canal on behalf of the three noble houses who own it in equal parts: Gruber, Holzkrug, and Holswig-Schleistein. There is an @Pay[18ss]{18/–} toll per barge to enter the canal, or @Pay[2gc]{2 GC} for barges over 12ft wide, collected at either the Reiksport or Weissbruck end. There are no further toll points along the canal itself. All House Gruber narrow boats use the canal for free, and they are a frequent sight along its length, pulled by horses and guarded by road wardens from the Weissbruck State Army.</p>\n<h4>Good Morning, Travellers</h4>\n<p>During the first morning down the canal, the Characters see a group of road wardens following them along the towpath  from Altdorf. The wardens are riding towards the second @JournalEntry[Hartsklein Lock and Lock Keeper's House]{Hartsklein Lock}<span style=\"white-space:nowrap;background-color:rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.05)\"> </span>beside the village of Hartsklein to check out a report of bandits being in the area. They are not looking for the Characters, but the party do not know this; and if they  left Altdorf ahead of a murder charge, they may be understandably nervous.</p>\n<p>The patrol catches up to the barge and trots alongside it. Sergeant Glucker, the patrol leader, is in a fine mood and chats with anyone on deck for a while, warning them that there may be bandits in the area and that a young noble and two artisans were killed last night in the city, down by the river. The patrol does not suspect anyone on the <em>Berebeli </em>— unless the Characters’ nervousness is obvious enough to make them suspicious — and it continues along its way after a short while.</p>\n<p>This encounter is designed to make the Players anxious, and to encourage them to hide or try to bluff the patrol. Josef counsels against the use of violence, as it will only lead to greater problems for all concerned. </p>\n<p>If the Characters attack, the patrol will defend itself; if the fight is still going on after 5 Rounds, the surviving road wardens break off and gallop back to Altdorf for reinforcements, taking the name of the Berebeli and detailed descriptions of the Characters with them. From then on, the Characters will be hunted by road wardens throughout the Reikland.</p>\n<h4>To Weissbruck</h4>\n<p>The remaining journey down @JournalEntry[MBMhy4NrPeACDEYl]{The Weissbruck Canal} is slow going. The Berebeli is far too wide to allow barges going in the other direction to pass freely, so stops are frequent to allow narrow boats, Reik barges, and more to pass. Not one of the encountered barge masters seems happy to see the Berebeli.</p>\n<p>‘<em>Get your fat barge off the Weissbruck!’, ‘You're too big!'’, ‘Go home!’ </em></p>\n<p>Josef doesn’t seem to care. He smiles, waves, takes a heavy slug of wine, and wishes all passers the blessings of Bögenauer. If any Characters ask what Bögenauer is, he explains.</p>\n<p><em>‘Bögenauer? Oh, he's the God of the River Bögen. Best to keep him happy in these parts. Chuck a vegetable in the canal, that should do. You have one, right!’</em></p>\n<p>And then it starts to rain again, and rather heavily. In these conditions, the canal journey takes almost three days. Fortunately, besides all the grumbling bargees cursing Josef and his huge barge, it is an uneventful trip. At night the Berebeli is tied up near to one of the lock-side inns, and the adventurers can relax by a warm fire as they have a drink and sample the local fare.

He claims Bögenhafen is the best place to secure repairs as it has the best facilities, barring Altdorf; but since the authorities in Altdorf are likely looking for Josef and his passengers, he does not wish to go there. Besides, he has cargo bound for Bögenhafen, and contracts to fulfil there. Further, if some of the Player Characters signed on as crew for Bögenhafen, Josef is very disappointed if they decide to back out before they fulfil that contract.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>This sign of the Purple Hand needs to be investigated. Whoever this magister impedimentae was, he is bound to cause more trouble if one of the Characters is so easily mistaken for him.

Or they find letters placed on their pillows or in their clothing with the words, ‘<em>What news from Bögenhafen?</em>’ Or ‘<em>What of the inheritance</em>?’ and increasingly urgent demands that the magister impedimentae report in.

{"_id":"T7M3B1GwW5IMevgs","name":"Arriving In Altdorf","content":"<p>It takes several hours to negotiate the roads and causeways that lead through @JournalEntry[fZKynnyBSGStMXEQ]{Altdorf Flats}, the vast marshlands surrounding the imperial capital. Eventually the land rises to a patchwork of farmlands and small villages, and not long after that the white walls of Altdorf can be seen glimmering in the distance, stretching far to east and west. Just after dark, the Characters’ coach pulls in through the intricately carved Wolf Gate at the north of the City. They are unaware of the trouble they are about  to encounter.</p>\n<p>Altdorf is enormous, and it takes some time before the coach pulls into the open expanse of the Königplatz (King's Square) near the centre of the city.</p>\n<p>Eager bawds representing various inns converge on the passengers, each offering accommodation at ‘the best inns in city, guv’ - all ‘at very reasonable prices, with the best possible entertainment’. As the Königplatz is near the top of the Street of a Hundred Taverns, the city’s most notorious night spot, it could not be better located for tired travellers seeking food, drink, and possibly good times. However, it also turns out to be a place for meeting friends, both old and new. </p>\n<p>Stepping off the coach, the Characters are greeted by cries of  ‘Angelino's, best grub in town!’ and ‘Stay at the Cat and Fiddle! Finest music and the best beds!’ The cries are accompanied by ready hands reaching to take any passenger’s luggage in order to lead them in the general direction of their chosen inn. Arguments soon break out, and fists clench.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>What's Going On In Altdorf?</h3>\n<p>Behind every plot, every scheme, every turn of the wheel in Altdorf, lies Tzeentch, the Chaos God of Magic, Mutation, and Change. Its horrific influence is close, but hidden, and will not be revealed until <strong>Empire in Ruins</strong>. So, for the moment, play up the creepy atmosphere in subtle ways, unnerve the Characters just a little, and use the strange circumstances to push the party onwards to Bögenhafen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As the Characters attempt to press through the gathered throng, they are brought to a halt by loud trumpeting and the sounds of marching feet. In no time, a procession of soldiers belonging to the Reikland 1st Regiment of Foot, The Imperial Guard, pushes its way through the platz. The Emperor, looking square of jaw and proud in full armour, and mounted on a magnificent ebony steed barded in gold, rides behind the marching phalanx. Beside and behind him march ranks of knights in their full ceremonial regalia. The assembled crowds cheer as the procession proceeds. Only once the entire parade has passed does business resume.</p>\n<p>Unknown to the Characters, this is not the actual Emperor. This is one of his doubles. The real Emperor is convalescing in the Imperial Palace across the river, some distance away. The double is abroad to still the rumours of his increasing frailty. It’s the fourth time he has marched across the Königplatz this week, and already rumours are spreading that the Emperor has a double. <strong>Note</strong>: it’s important the Characters see the Emperor’s double for reasons that will become clear in <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>, so do not skip this scene, or your own version of it.</p>\n<h3>Stop, Thief!</h3>\n<p>A couple of thieves are lurking amongst the crowds. They will attempt to take a piece of luggage from the coach or an unwary traveller and disappear into the crowd. If you wish, this may be a Character’s bag (if they let go, of course) or one belonging to an NPC on the coach.</p>\n<p>Once a thief takes a bag, the Characters have 1 Round to pursue the thief before the thronging crowds cover the getaway. No one will respond to cries of ‘Stop, thief!’ or similar; they are too preoccupied with their own business to care about anyone else’s problems. If any Characters pursue the thief, they must succeed at a <strong>Challenging (+0) Athletics</strong> Test each Round or lose their quarry in the press of people — they require 3 successful Tests in the first 3 Rounds to catch up to the thief. After 3 rounds without being caught, the thief — and the stolen luggage — @JournalEntry[Dnt7w9tejldGGYsn]{are gone forever}. If they lose an opposed intimidation test or take any wounds they'll drop the luggage and attempt to flee.</p>\n<h3>Prince Hergard von Tasseninck</h3>\n<p>If the Characters saw the notice of Crown Prince Hergard’s proposed expedition (@JournalEntry[lArlY0Y7hC0ArFvs]{Handout 1: Wanted! Bold Adventurers!}), they may wish to go to the prince’s residence in the hope of employment in the service of Ostland. </p>\n<p>The crown prince has a residence in an imposing riverside building not far from the bottom of the Street of a Hundred Taverns, on a street that leads from the Konigsplatz to the river. </p>\n<p>Anyone asked can direct the Characters to the estate on a successful <strong>Average (+20) Gossip</strong> Test. However, in the same breath, they will say that the crown prince set off southwards for the Grey Mountains three days ago, accompanied by a very tough-looking group of adventurers and a small army of staff. </p>\n<p>If the Characters investigate further, the bull-liveried guards at the crown prince’s gate confirm this. It seems the Characters are too late; the crown prince and his entourage have already left the city by barge, heading south with the intent of disembarking at Bögenhafen.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-eis/assets/set-pictures/procession.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 3 - Heart of the Empire","sort":150001},"cf":{"id":"temp_3x0rt108klt","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 3 - Heart of the Empire","color":"#24592b"}}}

Once the events of this chapter are set in motion, it is important that the ritual takes place that  evening so that the climax of the adventure occurs near or around midnight.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Meanwhile, Elsewhere</h3>\n<p>The previous evening, Teugen told the Inner Council that the ritual would take place at a new location, which was to be revealed at a future time. He also revealed that arrangements had been made to obtain a suitable victim for a sacrifice to consecrate the new temple. Magirius is appalled at this new revelation, and coupled with a very disturbing letter that he found in Teugen’s office, he decided to leave the Ordo. However, Magirius is no actor, and Teugen and Gideon are aware of his disaffection. They have decided to use him to dispose of the Characters. Or, at least, to keep them out of the way while final preparations are made for the ritual…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>An Unexpected Visit</h2>\n<p>In the morning of the day of the ritual, @Actor[7rE1jYAeMNKfrgcQ]{Magirius} seeks the Characters out. He looks pale and worried — a marked contrast from his appearance at the Golden Trout. He insists on being taken to a place where they will not be disturbed or overheard, and only then does he reveal the cause of his agitation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘When Teugen came to us from Nuln, he told us that, with our help, his sorcery could influence the economy of the Empire. Bögenhafen would become great again — greater even than Marienburg — and we would all become rich beyond our wildest dreams. That is why the Ordo Septenarius was established, and the lower ranks are no more than a smokescreen.</p>\n<p>‘Everything was going according to Teugen’s plans until you discovered the temple under the Steinhäger offices. I was instructed to reassure you — to make you go away, so that preparations for the ritual to make us all rich could carry on.</p>\n<p>‘The ritual will take place tonight. I don’t know where yet, but I will get word to you as soon as I can. Teugen said that a human sacrifice is necessary to prepare the new temple, and that was too much for me. I didn’t realise anyone would have to be killed. You must help me. Going to the authorities is useless as Teugen and the Inner Council control them all. You are my only hope.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Magirius then gives the Characters the letter that had accompanied the scroll acquired by Teugen on the day of their arrival in Bögenhafen. Give the players @JournalEntry[eiuxOcHqsnpkM39a]{Handout 10: Herzen's Letter}. Magirius then leaves, promising to contact them as soon as he finds out the new location of the ritual. He refuses to let the party accompany him as he dares not be seen with the Characters.</p>\n<h2>A Message</h2>\n<p>In the late afternoon, a message is delivered to the Characters, wherever they happen to be in the town. The messenger is a servant in Magirius’s livery. He hands over a rolled-up piece of parchment bearing the town seal (@JournalEntry[sOZxKLCS527tkGx8]{Handout 11: Magirius's Note}), and leaves without a word.</p>\n<p>Any Character who has spent any time in a Burgher career, or with any @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette} Talent knows that messengers and errand-boys generally hang around in the hope of a tip after delivering a message - the messenger's swift and silent departure seems odd. </p>\n<p>The young servant is, in fact, @Actor[IvvkdVTJzutEsrlX]{Gideon} in disguise.

{"_id":"W5Vlse4MqEGsN1lu","name":"Options: What? No Mutants?","content":"<p>If the Players are expecting Mutants, you may want to surprise them with a different encounter. For the sake of the campaign storyline, the Characters must happen upon the body of Kastor Lieberung and find the two letters he was carrying: how that happens is not important at all. Even if this is the Players’ first time through this adventure, the following alternatives to the Mutant attack may inspire you.</p>\n<h3>An Official Investigation</h3>\n<p>When the party comes upon the site of the wrecked coach, two road wardens are already there. They stop the adventurers’ coach and demand help loading the victims’ bodies on to a cart. They will be taken to the nearest town for burial, while the bodies of three mutants killed in the attack will be burned on the spot, using the wreckage of the coach as fuel.</p>\n<p>As they help the road wardens, the Characters may have the opportunity to loot a couple of bodies unseen: what they recover is up to you. Having come upon the body of Kastor Lieberung and noticed the resemblance to one of the Player Characters, they may claim to be relatives and ask to take the body and any personal effects. At your discretion, a successful use of Charm or Bribery ensures success. Of course, the Characters now have a body to worry about, and Lady Isolde will definitely not brook any attempt to bring it aboard the coach.</p>\n<p>If the Players are annoyingly complacent about the expected ambush, you can turn the tables on them by describing the adventurers’ first sight of the scene ambiguously. The road wardens are not wearing any obvious uniforms and their insignia are not visible as they direct a ragged group of farm labourers who happened to be passing by on a cart of dung: as they move among the bodies, it is hard to tell whether they are investigating or looting; their ragged, dirty clothing, filthy faces, and hunched postures could easily seem at first glance to be signs of minor mutations; and one or more might be chewing as they crouch over fallen bodies, with pasties unseen in their hands as they look up blankly when the adventurers come on the scene. </p>\n<p>With a little imagination, you could convince over-eager players that these are Mutants, and they could find themselves in trouble if they attack road wardens going about their duty.</p>\n<h3>Bandits</h3>\n<p>As mentioned in @JournalEntry[d7OJG0EAQanIOaGO]{Options: Looking For A Cheat},  the staff of the Coach and Horses Inn may be lookouts for a bandit gang. Instead of Mutants, the Characters encounter Outlaws looting the wrecked coach, but otherwise the chapter proceeds unchanged.</p>\n<h3>Don’t I Know You?</h3>\n<p>Instead of finding the body of Kastor Lieberung, the adventurers may encounter him in the flesh, along with a handful of other cultists. </p>\n<p>He is a cult priest in the @JournalEntry[UW37AxkhQtUr3GuS]{Cult Magus} Career). His magic allowed him and his companions to defeat the Mutants who attacked their coach, but the coach is still wrecked, Lieberung and several of his companions are wounded, and they stop the adventurers’ coach begging for a ride. </p>\n<p>When they are refused — and @Actor[goVesadmHWsl5E98]{Lady Isolde} is sure to insist that such grubby, bloodstained ne’er-do-wells leave her coach alone — they attack. Although you must make sure Lieberung is killed in the ensuing battle, the adventurers and everyone else have plenty of time to notice how much he resembles one of the Characters.</p>\n<h3>The Ratmen</h3>\n<p>The Skaven are an important part of the <strong>Enemy Within</strong> campaign from <strong>Death on the Reik</strong> onwards. If you wish to introduce the secretive ratmen early, you have a perfect opportunity to do so here. </p>\n<p>In addition to the documents relating to his supposed inheritance, Lieberung was transporting a piece of warpstone in a lead-lined box. A group of Skaven followed him from Middenheim, intent on stealing the warpstone for themselves.

{"_id":"YkFxRtASiOXlSPbi","name":"Cómo dirigir una Campaña","content":"<p>Una campaña de rol es una serie de aventuras enlazadas. Además de ser una historia en sí misma, cada aventura avanza la trama de la campaña en conjunto y nutre las temáticas subyacentes a la historia que se esté contando. Durante el camino, los Personajes exploran una gran área del mundo del juego y los Jugadores se familiarizan con esa cultura, esa sociedad y los diversos peligros que acechan en ella. </p>\n<h3>El Amplio Mundo</h3>\n<p>Mientras los PJs combatan al enemigo por el Imperio, oirán noticias y rumores de todo el mundo. No es simplemente un telón de fondo estático para las aventuras, es un reino vital y activo con millones de habitantes, donde siempre pasan cosas. Algunos sucesos sólo sirven para dar la impresión de que el mundo es más grande, otros refuerzan la atmósfera del escenario y las temáticas de la campaña y los hay que se convierten en pistas y encuentros que desarrollan la campaña en conjunto.</p>\n<p>Algunos pueden tentar a los Jugadores a seguir caminos secundarios, apelando a su curiosidad o incluso llevándolos a concluir, de manera errónea, que son pistas relacionadas con el argumento principal de la campaña. Cuando el grupo parece ir en la dirección equivocada, te enfrentas a una elección: obligar a los PJs a volver a la trama o complacer a los Jugadores por un tiempo y dejarlos vagar.</p>\n<h3>Mundo Abierto frente a Aventura Lineal</h3>\n<p>Cuando se dirige una campaña, el mayor desafío es mantener a los PJs en el camino sin que resulte demasiado obvio. Los Jugadores pueden frustrarse con rapidez si sospechan que se les está restringiendo la libertad de acción y los ‘llevan de un lugar a otro de la campaña’,. Por tanto, debes transmitir la impresión de que hay todo un mundo vivo para que los PJs lo exploren, al tiempo que te aseguras de que quieran ir adonde la campaña los lleve y, a ser posible, de que los Jugadores crean que han elegido el camino que van a seguir.</p>\n<p>Esto requiere mucho equilibrio: prepárate para seguirles el juego a los Jugadores si toman un par de desvíos. Ello requiere rapidez de pensamiento e improvisación, pero –si se conoce bien el mundo del juego– puede ser divertido llevar a cabo alguna que otra sesión ‘sobre la marcha’. Hay grupos que prefieren este estilo de juego de ‘mundo abierto’ a seguir un rumbo fijo: exploran el escenario a voluntad y se detienen cuando algo interesante les llama la atención. Este estilo de juego es tan válido como cualquier otro.</p>\n<p>Se proporcionan opciones para tratar con Jugadores descarriados y maneras de traerlos de vuelta a la trama principal cuando sea necesario. Aunque hay ciertos sucesos clave en el argumento de la campaña, como puntos de referencia en una ruta, puede haber muchas maneras diferentes de ir de uno a otro. El Enemigo en las Sombras comienza como un viaje, pero se dan algunas opciones para que los Jugadores hagan ese viaje como les plazca. Después se vuelve más libre, lo que permitirá a los PJs seguir su propio curso después de descubrir las primeras pistas que pusieron en marcha la aventura.</p>\n<h3>Hazlo Tuyo</h3>\n<p>Sobre todo, no debes sentirte encorsetado por el material que hay en estas páginas. No hay una forma correcta o incorrecta de jugar esta campaña: una partida de rol es un medio interactivo y los Jugadores dan forma a la historia tanto como el Director de juego y los autores. La mayoría de DJs experimentados están de acuerdo en que no hay forma de saber lo que un grupo de Jugadores hará, incluso en las situaciones más sencillas. Parte del desafío (y del placer) de un DJ es la necesidad de reaccionar, improvisar y entretener en respuesta a lo que los Jugadores decidan que hagan los PJs.</p>\n<p>Las aventuras que siguen son un recurso que debe utilizarse como inspiración, y no un guion que deba seguirse como un borrego. Deja que los Jugadores exploren el mundo y se abran un poco de camino; casi siempre estarán dispuestos a volver a la trama de la campaña tarde o temprano. Un DJ hábil encontrará más formas de tentarlos con el argumento que la simple exploración.</p>\n<p>Cada grupo es una colección única de individuos, y nadie conoce a tu grupo mejor que tú. Por lo tanto, siempre debes sentirte libre de adaptar las aventuras escritas añadiendo o cambiando detalles para dar el tipo de experiencia de juego que el grupo prefiera. Mientras todos se lo pasen bien, no hay una forma incorrecta de jugar.</p>\n<h3>Después de la Aventura</h3>\n<p>Cada episodio de la campaña original de El Enemigo Interior se escribió para que fuera útil aun después de que la aventura ya se hubiera completado. Para ello, la primera parte contenía información sobre el Imperio, donde se desarrolla la campaña, así como la aventura introductoria de El Enemigo Interior.</p>\n<p>Del mismo modo, Sombras sobre Bögenhafen le daba al DJ toda una ciudad comercial para usar en futuras aventuras. Con un nombre diferente y algunos cambios en el mapa, Bögenhafen podía valer por docenas de ciudades a lo largo del Imperio, lo cual permitía que se utilizara una y otra vez.</p>\n<p>Esta versión del director sigue el mismo modelo y ofrece una mezcla de aventura y material de trasfondo para crear un conjunto mayor. Todo esto se amplía aún más con los cinco Compendios de El Enemigo Interior, cada uno de los cuales está lleno de material útil, de ambientaciones y de escenarios para ampliar la campaña y permitir que la partida continúe mucho después de que ésta haya concluido.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>El Libro 2: Muerte en el Reik </strong>es el siguiente volumen de la campaña. Incluye información detallada sobre los grandes ríos del Imperio, los artesanos que los surcan y la cultura de los ribereños, así como reglas para transportar mercancíasy comerciar.</li>\n<li><strong>El Libro 3: El Poder tras el Trono </strong>describe cómo aventurarse por Middenheim, una gran ciudad del Imperio donde se pueden tener muchas otras correrías.</li>\n<li><strong>El Libro 4: La Rata Cornuda </strong>examina a los viles skavens, una raza de ratas del Caos que se esconde bajo el Viejo Mundo en busca del mágico mineral conocido como ‘piedra bruja’.</li>\n<li><strong>El Libro 5: El Imperio en Ruinas</strong> termina la campaña y profundiza en las clases políticas y militares del Imperio, ademásde proporcionar información sobre Altdorf, la gran capital del mismo.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Introduction","sort":87501},"cf":{"id":"temp_3rf4tb5n579","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Introducción","color":"#185b72"}}}

{"_id":"aZNjpWmxYygMwKFy","name":"Adventuring in the Capital","content":"<p>Our Heroes’ coach emerges from the Drakwald forest and speeds southwards for white-walled @JournalEntry[4WEhiObwXJKErVFi]{Altdorf}, the capital of the Empire and its largest, richest city. </p>\n<p>From the outskirts, the Imperial Palace can be seen rising high above the river Reik, dominating the city. All year round, Altdorf acts as the playground of the nobility. Young nobles travel from their parents’ estates to the city, there to spend their time drinking and flaunting their wealth in the streets. Many are supposed to be studying at Altdorf University, but few attend lectures — much to the relief, it must be said, of the professors. This gives them more time to concentrate on their more serious students or, in the case of a lucky few, dedicate themselves to research or simply to living on their ample incomes.</p>\n<p>Being such an enormous city, all services can be found in Altdorf if you look hard enough, and nearly all goods are available — for a price. When checking for availability of goods in Altdorf, if you fail you may retry an Availability Test daily, not weekly, and Exotic goods gain an Availability rating of 10%. Further, if you are willing to pay double the price for an item, you may reroll one failed <strong>Availability</strong> Test daily.</p>\n<h2>Adventuring In The Capital</h2>\n<p>The @Scene[aQ5GINBrubaDGQw4]{map of Altdorf} shows the city’s major districts and a few of its more important structures. This chapter of the adventure passes briefly though the imperial capital, so the only details provided are those needed to play. The adventurers will return to Altdorf later in the campaign, and you will be provided with more thorough information on the capital at that time; for now it is best to encourage the party to follow the lead to Bögenhafen and the promise of sudden wealth. However, if you wish to dwell longer in the city, refer to <strong>Altdorf: City of Sigmar</strong> for a complete examination of the capital, with extra details also presented in <strong>Death on the Reik</strong> and  <strong>Empire in Ruins</strong>.</p>\n<p>As will be seen in the following pages, the bounty hunter @Actor[echM0Sjy5xpt5KAQ]{Adolphus Kuftsos} is closing in on Kastor Lieberung, and kills any cultist he sees making contact with the Characters. </p>\n<p>If the Characters are showing an unwelcome inclination to explore Altdorf rather than travelling on to Bögenhafen, you can improvise an escalating series of unnerving but non-fatal attacks on the party, with more cultists being murdered by bolts from the shadows as the Purple Hand agents continue their attempts to make contact by means of strange gestures. Unable to catch the assailant and worried by the increasing violence, the Characters should eventually conclude that Altdorf is too hot for them and move on.</p>\n<h3>Something Rotten in Altdorf</h3>\n<p>Something is very wrong in Altdorf. Those living in the capital are quite used to it, inured to its subtle, pervasive influence, but those freshly arrived can’t help but feel… uneasy, and find themselves getting lost rather easily, as if the streets themselves don’t meet up correctly.</p>\n<h4>A Change of Scene</h4>\n<p>When first describing Altdorf, focus in on details suggesting the city is changing from one state into another, and often in contrary ways. Many buildings are being refurbished or repainted, while others are falling apart. One town crier claims a well-regarded Altdorf philanthropist was found guilty of corruption and jailed, whilst another claims a penniless street rat was found to be heir to the Rickard-Goellner estates. Also make sure to describe agitators by the scores crowding the streets, all clamouring for a new order, desperate for the capital to be better. To be different.</p>\n<p>Many of the city’s bustling burghers are acting oddly, too - though few notice it, simply presuming Altdorf life breeds a permanent state of hustle and fuss. Everyone in the capital is filled with an impatience permeating their very souls. Coachmen crack whips and bellow at others to get out of the way. Scholars rush about clutching books, all seemingly on important tasks that cannot wait. Shoppers refuse to buy from the same place twice, sure the next vendor may have a better deal. Everyone has somewhere to go, and they never get there fast enough. Altdorf is restless, irritable, and anxious. Even the stray dogs are agitated, barking at walls and each other, prone to dashing at the slightest threat, eyes wide, teeth bared, drool slopping from their quivering chops.</p>\n<h4>A Change of Character</h4>\n<p>Passing through Altdorf influences the Characters in some rather unexpected ways, almost as if the Dark Gods were keeping a close eye on their actions…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All spellcasters gain +1 SL to any Language (Magick) or Channelling Tests. Unless their roll includes a 9 on either die (such as 19, or 92), where they instead gain +[[/gmr 1d10]] SL and suffer a @Table[majormis]{Major Miscast}.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>All non-wizards with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.mNoCuaVbFBflfO6X]{Sixth Sense} Talent feel uneasy at all times, and cannot use their Talent’s rules.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Roll [[/gmr 1d10]] each day. On a roll of an 8, one random Character gains 1 Corruption point. On a roll of 9, one random Character randomly determines a new hair or eye colour (your choice). On a roll of 10, one Character gains +1 Fortune point.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Any Character with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.Nj3tC8A5fZ3zEdMR]{Holy Visions} Talent suffers terrible nightmares that are forgotten on waking.

{"_id":"as1T0C1NGIHrUj48","name":"Options: The Vampire Bluff","content":"<p>Veteran players know that Teugen is not a Vampire, and will likely refuse to be led astray by appearances. That is fine: this throwaway joke is entirely optional, and you are free to ignore it even with an all-new party. However, when dealing with Grognard players, you should take every opportunity to subvert their expectations and strip the Players of the sense of security that their previous experience gives them: to which end, the following ideas may be useful.</p>\n<h3>A Bloody Nuisance</h3>\n<p>Perhaps Teugen really is a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T5qAtpoKtB8iwTBd]{Vampire}, or maybe a Mutant with all of a Vampire’s outward traits having been granted that rather dubious gift as a sign of Tzeentch’s favour, or as a joke from Gideon. While Teugen tries to control his vampiric urges  and temper when dealing with the Characters, he might not succeed, especially if attacked. An unexpected attack would certainly surprise a Grognard player. Perhaps a failed Cool Test in a moment of stress (or temptation: he may have a weakness for the young and attractive like the Vampires of song, story, and cliché) may turn him into a raging monster.</p>\n<p>If you do this, you need to make sure that Gideon has a back-up should Teugen fail, such as relying on another Ordo Septenarius member to complete the ritual to open the Chaos Gate.</p>\n<h3>Signs of Corruption</h3>\n<p>Perhaps, instead of seeming to be a Vampire, Teugen appears to be something else. Perhaps he really is something else, but he has been able to hide his true nature from his fellow merchants and his subordinates in the Ordo Septenarius. He may have one or two minor Mutations that are easily hidden, but which the Characters, having encountered Mutants before, are able to spot. His long robes might hide a cloven hoof, or a nervous lick of the lips when pressed might reveal a forked or barbed tongue.</p>\n<p>Whatever his Mutations might be, it is important that they are very minor and easily concealed, so that it is plausible that no one in the town has noticed them. It is easy for him to deny them if the Characters manage to have their report taken seriously by someone in authority.

But what does all that mean when roleplaying these Characters?</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it’s up to you. A GM from London will view Empire accents very differently to a GM from Berlin, or from New York, Mumbai, or Melbourne, so there is no point in us telling you something like: ‘all Altdorf accents are  synonymous with London accents’, as that may sound like nonsense to you, as surely it should be a Berliner accent, or a Parisian one, or something else. </p>\n<p>So, assuming you like to mimic different accents, it’s up to you to decide what a Middenlander sounds like in your games, or a Stirlander, or a Nordlander. Assign the accents you prefer to each of the provinces and major cities, and you’re good to go. If you are looking for guidelines for how to do this, consider the table opposite, which is presented as a loose guide only.</p>\n<table style=\"height:340px;width:100%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\"><strong>Accents</strong></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%;text-align:center\"><strong>How to choose your version of the accent</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\"><strong>Cities</strong></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\">Altdorf</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%\">Accent of your capital city</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\">Talabheim</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%\">Accent of a nearby capital city or important city</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\">Middenheim</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%\">Accent from a provincial city</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\">Nuln</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%\">Like Altdorf, but with a strong rising inflection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\"><strong>Provinces</strong></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\">Averland</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%\">Sing-song tones</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\">Hochland</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%\">Rustic with colloquialism</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\">Middenland</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%\">Tough and direct</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\">Mootland</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%\">Thick rural accent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\">Nordland</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%\">Aggressive and passionate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\">Ostland</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%\">Uses pauses for stress</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\">Ostermark</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%\">Thick Theatrical accent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\">Reikland</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%\">Your accent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\">Stirland</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%\">Rural and sophisticated</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\">Sudenland</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%\">LIke Reikland, but monotone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\">Sylvania</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%\">Classic vampire accent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\">Talabecland</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%\">Suburban Talabheim accent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:23.6307%;text-align:center\">Wissenland</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:76.3693%\">Monotone with a rising inflection</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Appendices","sort":200001},"cf":{"id":"temp_6ptt9egvnj","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Appendices","color":"#53205e"}}}

Maybe the bandits are holding his wife and children — who are all absent from the inn when the Characters visit — and if confronted he might break down and offer the adventurers a reward to rescue them and deal with the bandits?</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the coachmen @Actor[ND9BHKtUxtQqty7w]{Gunnar} and @Actor[uzWAvJDoBl0osDnW]{Hultz} might be the bandits in disguise, and are only pretending to be drunk!

{"_id":"eSfUKiIYJM8nlFmT","name":"The Mayhem Mystery Tour","content":"<p>Rounding the corner or sneaking through the woods, the Characters come upon a ghastly scene. An overturned coach lies across the road, with bodies littering the ground around it. Two of its horses are desperately trying to struggle free of their harnesses as a creature with a large body and an incredibly small head hacks maniacally at them with an axe. </p>\n<p>A @Actor[cKp4JV3XNZ5l67eM]{Human} with a doglike head is lying screaming next to the coach. Blood pumps from his wounded leg while another @Actor[CC24r6wLC9Gce4GL]{Mutant} with a pointed head tries to bandage it. A fourth @Actor[50xLTGTs9Cq2VrGF]{Mutant}, with cloven feet, is feasting on one of the bodies. Searching through the various corpses is a Human with scaly skin holding a loaded crossbow. This is @Actor[7mUvNXJrBedMDmrg]{Knud Cratinx}, the Mutants’ leader.</p>\n<p>If the Characters attack, the Mutants, who are not paying much attention to their surroundings, receive a <a></a>@Condition[Surprised] Condition. If the Characters choose only missile combat, the confused Mutants receive a Surprised Condition for two Rounds, meaning they can fire 2 Rounds of missiles before the Mutants react. The Mutants then rush to attack while Knud stays back, shooting at the Characters with his crossbow. Once two Mutants are killed, the others turn and flee into the forest. Their trail can be followed for half a mile before it peters out; no amount of searching uncovers the trail after this. If the Characters enter the forests, try to make them uneasy by calling their attention to strange rustles in the undergrowth, dark shapes that seem to loom at the edge of their vision, and the complete absence of any animal or insect sounds. The Characters are safe at the moment, but they should not know this!</p>\n<p>The corpses littered around the overturned coach are its other coachman, a pair of artisans, an initiate of Sigmar, and a labourer. The coachman still wears his sleeved mail shirt, and his blunderbuss and shot lie next to his body. None of the other bodies have anything of value as Knud has collected it all. If Knud is killed and searched, the Characters find <a></a>@Pay[2gc3ss13bp]{2 GC, 3/13}, a ring worth 3 GC, and a silver locket worth 1 GC with a miniature of one of the dead artisans in it. All of these are listed in @Actor[7mUvNXJrBedMDmrg]{Knud’s} Trappings.</p>\n<h3>The Double</h3>\n<p>As the Characters look over the scene of the ambush or pursue the Mutants into the woods, they notice another body lying under a bush, a little way from the coach but not far enough to be overlooked. The body has two crossbow bolts stuck in its back and wears clothes that identify it as a town dweller, possibly an artisan. This is the body of Kastor Lieberung (see @JournalEntry[EvAGlPfaaNO6UZXk]{The Story}, a senior cultist of the Purple Hand. Kastor was on his way from Middenheim to Bögenhafen to collect an inheritance. When the coach was attacked, he attempted to slip away, only to be cut down by two of Knud’s crossbow bolts.</p>\n<p>Turning the corpse over, the Characters are in for a shock, because he looks exactly like one of them! Which one is up to you. The ideal Character would be the one who is likely to be taken with the idea of impersonating Kastor in order to gain  his inheritance.</p>\n<p>A blood-stained piece of parchment is protruding from the corpse’s jacket. Give the Players @JournalEntry[DjUfTwXeZ150VSaW]{Handout 3: The Inheritance}. Bloodstains obscure some of the details. After reading it, the Characters should be keen to journey to Bögenhafen to claim the inheritance.</p>\n<p>In an inside pocket is another, unstained letter, @JournalEntry[pVrcstcA1ZgzDnux]{Handout 4: The Affidavit}.</p>\n<h3>The Arrival of the Law</h3>\n<p>Not long after the Characters inspect the scene of the ambush, they notice horsemen riding from the direction of Altdorf. This is a patrol of five road wardens led by @Actor[qV5dluDJYZGoMpl1]{Magnus Pflaster}, and they will gallop up to the Characters as soon as they spot the upturned coach.</p>\n<p>The road wardens are initially very suspicious of the adventurers, who likely look a lot like bandits at first glance. The road wardens demand to know what is going on, and inspect the scene very closely. Provided the Characters are polite and explain about the Mutants, the road wardens believe them. But insults and threats, on the other hand, lead the road wardens to arrest the Characters, taking them to the next coaching inn for a detailed interrogation.</p>\n<p>Taking charge of the scene, the road wardens press every able-bodied Character they can into service. Clearly, @Actor[goVesadmHWsl5E98]{Lady Isolde} and her staff are exempt from such work, but everyone else is expected to help. With a little effort, and whatever dice rolls you consider necessary, the overturned coach is righted. One of its two remaining horses, fatally injured, is put out of its misery while the other is calmed by the presence of the road wardens and their horses.</p>\n<p>The @Actor[guaFC5d5WK8ExDhk]{Horse}from the Characters’ coach are grazing a short way into the woods. If approached by a Character without any Advances in the Ride (Horse), Animal Care, or Charm Animal Skills, the Horses are still skittish and lash out; the Character must make a Dodge Test to skip in close enough to grab the remains of their harness and control the animals. If the Characters are unable to accomplish this, some of the road wardens step in and calm the Horses with practised ease.</p>\n<p>The remaining horses are divided between the two coaches and makeshift repairs are made to their damaged harnesses. </p>\n<p>With the Characters’ party back in their coach and the corpses piled up in the other one, the road wardens lead the way to the next inn. There, sworn statements are taken from each living witness to the Mutant attack, and the bodies are prepared for the arrival of a Doomsayer, a wandering Priest of Morr.</p>\n<p>No efforts are made to identify the unfortunate dead. The Empire is a violent place, and the road wardens simply do not have the resources to track down and inform the relatives of every dead traveller. Instead, it is left for the cult of Morr to note the details of the dead and then pass them to the local cult of Verena where records of all deaths are stored. </p>\n<p>Kastor Lieberung’s body has no identification other than the two letters that are now in the Characters’ possession, so he is likely ruled an unknown. If any of the Characters feels compelled by the spirit of honesty to mention the letters, the road wardens make it clear that they have neither the time nor the inclination to deal with such trivialities. ‘<em>In Sigmar's name, be about your business and stop bothering me!’</em></p>\n<p>If the Characters have not taken steps to disguise Kastor’s double, or to disfigure Kastor’s corpse, the road wardens will wryly note the similarity (‘<em>Is it your twin? Bad luck, mate.</em>’), but take no further action. All of them have seen odder things during their long patrols through the Drakwald forest. And, besides, enquiring after suspicious dopplegangers is more than their job’s worth.</p>\n<p>The remainder of the journey to the next coaching inn passes without mishap. The Characters pass a couple of coaches bound for Delberz, some merchant trains, a detachment of State Army cavalry, and anything else you deem appropriate. As darkness sets in, the coach finally arrives at its destination, the last stop before Altdorf, the Inn of the Seven Spokes.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 2 - Mistaken Identity","sort":1},"cf":{"id":"temp_yfji25xqkd","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 2 - Mistaken Identity","color":"#023582"}}}

{"_id":"frGAWz56TOL7V2bn","name":"Al acercarse a la posada","content":"<p>Se supone que los Personajes llegan a la posada temprano, justo cuando se va la última diligencia. Si quieres que lleguen en otro momento, haz los cambios necesarios en la información que aparece a continuación. Cuando los PJs se acercan a la posada, una diligencia sale por las puertas. La diligencia pertenece a la compañía Cuatro Estaciones y viaja hacia Middenheim (u otro destino adecuado); acaba de reparar una rueda y el conductor se apresura a recuperar el tiempo perdido. Una vez cruzadas las puertas, éste pone los caballos al galope y enfila el camino a una velocidad vertiginosa. La diligencia no se detiene ante nadie, y el conductor azotará con el látigo a cualquier PJ que se interponga en el camino. Si los PJs intentan detenerla, el guarda, alzando el trabuco, les gritará que se hagan a un lado. Si esto no los detiene, no dudará en disparar: es un disparo <strong>Difícil (-20)</strong> usando la HP 32 del cochero: Daño: +8, Explosiva 3, Peligrosa. El cochero atropellará a cualquier Personaje lo bastante inepto para interponerse en el camino de los caballos. A menos que estos PJs pasen un Chequeo <strong>Normal (+20) de Esquivar </strong>para salir de la trayectoria, sufrirán [[/r 1d10+6]] Heridas (modificadas por Resistencia, pero no por PA). El patio de la posada es un hervidero cuando los PJs llegan. Un denso olor a estiércol fresco flota en el aire. Se ve a un par de mozos de cuadras fuera de los establos, almohazando un tiro de cuatro caballos. De la posada misma viene el delicioso olor de la cocina y el sonido de una alegre risa.</p>\n<h3>La diligencia</h3>\n<p>Hay una diligencia en el patio de la posada. Lleva la librea de @JournalEntry[gCFx3Jzxj3h2EL49]{Lineas Ratchett} de Altdorf, una antigua casa de diligencias que lucha por sobrevivir ante la competencia de la compañía Cuatro Estaciones. El carruaje ha llegado esta la tarde y saldrá hacia Altdorf por la mañana. En estos momentos, los pasajeros y los cocheros están relajándose en el bar de la posada. A primera vista, la diligencia parece estar en buenas condiciones, pero los Personajes que la miren de cerca y pasen un Chequeo <strong>Desafiante (+0) de Percepción</strong> o un Chequeo <strong>Fácil (+40) de Oficio (carpintería)</strong> o similar, se darán cuenta de que está vieja y destartalada. Debajo de la pintura y el pulimento brillante, la estructura de la diligencia está podrida y plagada de carcoma.</p>\n<h3>El bar</h3>\n<p>@JournalEntry[LX7znyt49VE0FGn8]{El bar}es un lugar brillante y alegre. Al abrir la puerta, los PJs huelen las viandas que se están cocinando y oyen las risas de los dos cocheros, que beben y bromean juntos. Desde el otro lado de la habitación, los aventureros notan la mirada helada de una joven mujer, vestida finamente (la dama @Actor[goVesadmHWsl5E98]{Isolde von Strudeldorf}) ). Se sienta a una mesa con otras dos mujeres: una es alta y de complexión fuerte (@Actor[LBc3rDFHm6j2rI6C]{Marie}, la guardaespaldas) y la otra es pequeña y de aspecto tímido ( @Actor[s3C4siPuECgh14Vl]{Janna Elleiner}, la sirvienta). Un joven (@Actor[Ernst Heidlemann]) está en otra mesa y parece absorto en un libro. Apoyado en la barra hay un elegante caballero (@Actor[RXY98JwsYTfmOfGa]{Phillipe Descartes}) que observa con detenimiento a los PJs antes de volver a mirar la barra. Un camarero de aspecto delgado (@Actor[EFX8iIi0LTkzcASP]{Herpin}) y el regordete posadero (@Actor[ND2uvL1HRLr0ggfw]{Gustav}) están detrás de ésta. Sobre la barra, apostado en una viga de madera manchada de guano, está el cuervo mascota del propietario, @Actor[fuSC9ZpTC5GfxZJT]{Tizón}. Antes de que los PJs hagan mucho más que captar la escena, Gustav, el gordo y efusivo dueño, se acerca a ellos. Sonríe cálidamente y saluda a los aventureros con una charla interminable:<em> ‘¡Saludos! Bienvenidos a La Diligencia y los Caballos. Por favor, sentaos. Poneos junto al fuego, allí se está mejor y más caliente. ¿Querríais algo de beber o de comer? ¿Sí? Claro, las bebidas primero. ¡Qué tonto!’. Mientras Gustav balbucea, Tizón se pavonea en la viga sobre la barra, imitando la voz de Gustav casi a la perfección, pero mezclando las palabras: ‘¿Bienvenidos al asiento? ¿Poneos una mejor por tonto? ¿Bebidas con los caballos?’</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>DE TONTOS Y CABALLOS</h3>\n<em>Al inicio de la aventura, es importante que los Personajes intenten conseguir un carruaje a Altdorf. Esto implica que no deberían tener caballos y que no deberían poder adquirir caballos antes de llegar a Bögenhafen. Si ninguno de los Personajes empieza como jinetes o escuderos, que empiezan con caballos, esto no es mucho problema: los Personajes iniciales no pueden permitirse comprar caballos y puedes hacer fácilmente que sea muy complicado conseguirlos de otras formas, como por ejemplo robando. Si los Jugadores parecen estar contemplando alguna actividad ilegal, puedes recordarles los riegos que ello implica. Si los Personajes incluyen a un jinete o escudero con un caballo, queda en tus manos cómo resolverlo. La forma más fácil es preguntarle al Jugador en cuestión: \"¿Por qué tu Personaje no tiene caballo?\" y crear una historia al respecto con él.</em></blockquote>\n<p>Mientras se acomodan en la mesa, los PJs se dan cuenta de que Phillipe Descartes los observa mucho. Cuando lo ven, Phillipe vuelve la mirada con rapidez hacia la copa de vino que tiene en la barra. Los demás huéspedes no reparan en ellos: la dama Isolda juega con la comida de forma quisquillosa mientras la criada tiene la mirada perdida; Marie, la guardaespaldas de Isolda, bebe vino de buena gana; la cabeza de Ernst Heidlemann está enterrada en un libro, que estudia con avidez toda la velada; los cocheros, Gunnar y Hultz, están ocupados emborrachándose, pues aprovechan la oportunidad para divertirse antes de que tengan que volver al camino por la mañana.</p>\n<h4>El alojamiento</h4>\n<p>Los pasajeros de la diligencia ocupan tres dormitorios. La dama @Actor[goVesadmHWsl5E98]{Isolde von Strudeldorf} Isolda y su doncella @Actor[s3C4siPuECgh14Vl]{Janna} comparten una habitación, mientras que la guardaespaldas @Actor[LBc3rDFHm6j2rI6C]{Marie} tiene una habitación contigua. @Actor[RXY98JwsYTfmOfGa]{Phillipe} el jugador y Ernst el estudiante tienen una habitación cada uno. Esto deja una habitación disponible para los PJs, que también pueden quedarse en la sala común con los dos cocheros.</p>\n<h4>Las puertas</h4>\n<p>Todas pueden cerrarse con llave, y a menudo lo están; poca precaución es poca, teniendo en cuenta la clase de gente que viaja por los caminos estos días. Por lo general, las únicas puertas que se dejan sin cerrar con llave son las de uso común.</p>\n<h3>Los PNJs</h3>\n<p>Esta parte de la aventura gira en torno a que los PJs hablen e interactúen con los PNJs de la posada. Para ello, debes dar vida a los PNJs: esto es muy fácil para la mayoría, ya que no hablan a menos que se les hable primero. Sin embargo, Gustav el posadero y Phillipe el jugador son diferentes, ya tomarán la iniciativa. Puedes poner en juego a otros PNJs cuando lo necesites o lo desees. Por ejemplo, si un aventurero pide a los cocheros que los lleven a Altdorf, deberás interpretar el papel del cochero. De lo contrario, sólo hay que llamar la atención de los aventureros sobre la bebida, las risas y las canciones ocasionales de éstos. Los detalles de todos los PNJs están al final del capítulo. Eres libre de cambiar o embellecer estos detalles según sea necesario para hacer la partida lo más entretenida posible para los Jugadores.</p>\n<h4>El dueño</h4>\n<p>@Actor[ND2uvL1HRLr0ggfw]{Gustav} el propietario es la entrada inicial a la posada. Recibe a los PJs tan pronto como llegan, hablando sin parar y deteniéndose sólo para que los aventureros le respondan. Pregunta por la salud de éstos, su destino, si quieren habitaciones, etc. Incluso llena el más breve momento de silencio con cháchara sobre negocios, el clima, el estado del camino y cualquier otra cosa que se le ocurra. Se muestra entusiasmado con los demás huéspedes, en especial con la dama Isolda, ya que está muy emocionado de tener a una mujer de la nobleza en la posada. Deberías interpretar a Gustav como un leve engorro, pero demasiado bondadoso como que alguien se enfade en serio con él. Cualquier comida, bebida o habitación que se le pida irá acompañado de una charla sin sentido sobre cualquiera de sus temas favoritos. Gustav es muy difícil de ofender, pero se enfadará si se le amenaza con violencia. En tal caso, ordenará a los PJs que salgan de la posada si son ‘incapaces de mantener un tono civilizado’.</p>\n<h4>El jugador</h4>\n<p>@Actor[RXY98JwsYTfmOfGa]{Phillipe}, un viajero bretoniano, cumple una función diferente: ofrece a los Personajes una partida de cartas y, si le pillan haciendo trampas, se desata una pelea. Es entretenido de representar ya que tiene un fuerte acento bretoniano (es decir, francés) y afición por los gestos extravagantes.</p>\n<h4>El camarero</h4>\n<p>A menos que la posada esté muy concurrida, @Actor[EFX8iIi0LTkzcASP]{Herpin} se queda detrás de la barra o en la bodega, sirviendo las bebidas como le ha ordenado Gustav, pero nunca acude a las mesas. Si algún cliente necesita algo, lo atiende el dueño, que lo someterá a una charla interminable a menos que lo esquive inteligentemente.</p>\n<h4>Los cocheros</h4>\n<p>Cuando el grupo entra en la posada, los dos cocheros, @Actor[ND9BHKtUxtQqty7w]{Gunnar} y @Actor[uzWAvJDoBl0osDnW]{Hultz}, ya están borrachos. A medida que avanza la noche, se ríen, beben, cantan, beben y bromean. Al final, tras beber un poco más, se van tambaleando hacia la cama. Aunque la diligencia está casi llena, se muestran dispuestos a llevar al grupo a la próxima posada que da servicio a @JournalEntry[gCFx3Jzxj3h2EL49]{Lineas Ratchett} (@JournalEntry[J8vyov8wh3Kx2rnw]{La posada de los Siete Radios}, un viaje de unas 50 millas) donde podrán abordar otro carruaje hasta Altdorf. Cobran @Pay[4cp]{4cp} por PJ que viaje fuera; pero, si pierden un <strong>Chequeo Enfrentado de Regatear</strong>, bajan el precio a @Pay[3cp]{3cp}; si lo pierden por 6 NE, se les puede regatear hasta @Pay[2cp]{2cp} por PJ. Cobran el doble a quien viaje dentro de la diligencia. Gunnar y Hultz exigen el pago por adelantado, y se gastarán el dinero que les den en más alcohol.</p>\n<h4>La noble</h4>\n<p>@Actor[goVesadmHWsl5E98]{La dama Isolde}} no hablará con los PJs, pues piensa que asociarse con gentuza así no es propio de ella. Si insisten en hablar con la mujer, parecerá muy molesta y mandará a la doncella, @Actor[s3C4siPuECgh14Vl]{Janna}, que les diga a los PJs que la dejen en paz. Janna hará esto más bien de manera dócil, mientras que @Actor[LBc3rDFHm6j2rI6C]{Marie}, la guardaespaldas de Isolda, los mirará con ojos amenazantes. Si los PJs persisten, Isolda y el séquito se retirarán a sus habitaciones.</p>\n<h4>El aprendiz</h4>\n<p>@Actor[Ernst Heidlemann]está tan contento, leyendo solo en una esquina del bar. Se asusta un poco si algún PJ se le acerca. Responde a las preguntas de forma distraída e intenta evitar las conversaciones si le es posible. Pide a cualquiera que lo moleste que lo deje en paz, alegando que tiene mucho que estudiar para el examen de entrada en la universidad. Ernst parece poco interesante, sin nada importante que decir, pero esconde un oscuro secreto (ver pág. 22).</p>\n<h4>Cómo vérselas con lo inesperado</h4>\n<p>La posada ofrece a los aventureros la oportunidad de pasar una tarde tranquila y encontrarse con PNJs del resto del mundo, un mundo del que solo han tenido un atisbo en la vida hasta la fecha. Los Jugadores nuevos pueden probar las reglas para todo tipo de interacciones sociales y, si eres un DJ novato, tienes la posibilidad de practicar presentando unos cuantos PNJs variados e interpretando el tipo de situaciones que es probable que los PJs encontrarán muchas veces en el futuro, en posadas de todo el Imperio. Sin embargo, siempre cabe la posibilidad de que algunos Jugadores decidan realizar algo que no esté cubierto en estas páginas de manera expresa. Por ejemplo, pueden intentar robar a un PNJ por la noche o quizá contratarse como guardaespaldas de la dama Isolda. Se ha proporcionado información suficiente para que puedas cubrir tales sucesos con un mínimo de esfuerzo: basta con usar las reglas del juego para interpretar estos sucesos y algo de imaginación para decidir cómo reaccionan los diferentes PNJs ante los PJs. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Handout 1: ¡Se buscan! ¡Aventureros Audaces!</h3>\n<p>En la Diligencia y los Caballos — o en otra posada a lo largo del camino — los Personajes ven un @JournalEntry[lArlY0Y7hC0ArFvs]{poster} que parece ofrecerles una oportunidad de aventura</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>¿Un juego de azar?</h3>\n<p>Phillipe Descartes mide a los Personajes al llegar éstos y los observa cuando cree que no están mirando. Si le hablan, se muestra amigable, aunque un poco cauteloso. Si los aventureros lo ignoran, se acerca a la mesa después de una media hora y les da conversación, tratando de congraciarse. Se acaricia la punta de la nariz (un hábito que tiene) y se ofrece a pagar una ronda. Después de preguntar de manera educada sobre los asuntos de los PJs, Phillipe sugiere una partida de la @JournalEntry[pWlAzCU8HjElHsqC]{Emperatriz Escarlata}, un popular juego de cartas del Imperio, para pasar el rato. Cada PJ que juegue intenta pasar un <strong>Chequeo Desafiante (+0) de Jugar</strong>, y la mano irá a parar al personaje con el NE más alto. Phillipe jugará por cualquier apuesta, pero considera una pérdida de tiempo jugar por menos de 2 cp. Pierde de manera deliberada las dos primeras manos (ignora las tiradas). Luego comienza a jugar en serio, usando el Talento Fullero para aumentar en <strong>+2 NE</strong> el éxito en los Chequeos de Juego. Phillipe también recurrirá al Talento Suerte para repetir las pruebas fallidas si las apuestas son altas. Sólo puede hacerlo tres veces antes de que se le acabe la suerte (ya que tiene el Talento tres veces). Intentará subir las apuestas cuando lo crea conveniente, con el objetivo de apostar alrededor de @Pay[8cp]{8cp} una mano. Si pierde tres manos seguidas jugando limpio, hará trampas, guardándose cartas en la mano o en la manga. Ello requiere un <strong>Chequeo Desafiante (+0) de Prestidigitación</strong>. Si tiene éxito, elige una de las dos siguientes opciones: 1) Invertir un <strong>Chequeo de Juego</strong> fallido; o 2) usar el<strong> NE de Prestidigitación</strong> en lugar del NE de Juego para determinar el ganador de la mano. Sin embargo, se le puede pillar: debes tirar en secreto un <strong>Chequeo Desafiante (+0) de Percepción</strong> enfrentado con el<strong> Chequeo de Prestidigitación</strong> de Phillipe. Cualquier PJ que tenga un NE más alto que el de Phillipe, lo verá hacer trampas. A menos que lo atrapen, Phillipe se retirará a dormir después de ganarle al grupo tanto dinero como estén dispuestos a apostar. Si se le acusa de tramposo, Phillipe lo negará con rotundidad y fingirá estar muy molesto de que alguien lo acuse. Intenta salir de cualquier situación con buenas palabras; pero, si las cosas pintan mal, sacará la pistola y abrirá fuego, confiando en el terrible estruendo del disparo y la nube de humo para intimidar a los Jugadores (ver el Rasgo de arma De pólvora negra en WJdR, pág. 298). Con el humo como cobertura, Phillipe se dirigirá a las escaleras y correrá hacia lo alto.</p>\n<h4>Repartiendo plomo</h4>\n<p>Los PJs que persigan a Phillipe por las escaleras se enfrentarán a un Gustav nervioso y confundido que blande el trabuco y les grita que se detengan. Gustav no tiene ni idea de lo que ha pasado abajo, pero pretende ponerle fin. Disparará a cualquiera que se mueva y caerá cuando el retroceso del trabuco lo desequilibre. Por supuesto, se disculpará profusamente cuando repare en la verdad de la situación. Desde lo alto de las escaleras, Phillipe saltará por la ventana a los establos. Realiza un <strong>Chequeo Normal (+20) de Atletismo</strong> y, si tiene éxito, la caída como contará una yarda menos, más una yarda más por NE positivo. Así que, si consigue +3 NE, aterrizará, rodará por el suelo y saldrá ileso. De lo contrario, sufrirá Daño por caída igual a [[/r 1d10]] Heridas + 3 por @JournalEntry[1gNxlCdPV1C3oZ6Z]{yarda que caiga}.</p>\n<p>Si sufre más heridas que su bonificador por Resistencia, también se le aplicará el Estado Tumbado, ya que se pegará una buena torta contra el suelo. Cualquier Personaje que quiera seguirlo a por la ventana puede hacer lo mismo (o tal vez descolgarse primero, lo que reducirá la distancia de caída a sólo 2 yardas, pero dará tiempo a Phillipe para escaparse). Si se le da alcance, Phillipe se volverá de mala gana para luchar. Prefiere @JournalEntry[Ssod4QuBdyMS6F79]{Contener sus golpes}para que no inflijan heridas críticas y usará el Talento Desarmar. Sin embargo, si lo atacan más de dos PJs a la vez, dejará de contenerse. Si su puntuación de Heridas se reduce a 3 o menos, se rendirá y devolverá el dinero que haya ganado en la partida. A menos que lo atrapen, huirá a Altdorf en un caballo del dueño. Cualquiera que intente seguirlo debe tener la Habilidad Montar y estar dispuesto a robar un caballo o pronto Phillipe lo dejará muy atrás.</p>\n<h4>Bienvenido a la cárcel</h4>\n<p>Lo que los PJs hagan con Phillipe si lo atrapan depende de ellos. Gustav no desea retenerlo en la posada y lo liberará tan pronto como los aventureros se vayan, a menos que tenga una buena razón para no hacerlo. Puede que el grupo insista en llevar a Phillipe ante la justicia, pero esto implicará largas (al menos [[/r 3d10]] días) y costosas (@Pay[50cp]{50}–@Pay[100cp]{100}cp por semana) disputas legales en Altdorf (a menos que uno un PJ sea abogado, por supuesto, lo que abaratará mucho los procedimientos legales). Además, un Chequeo <strong>Muy fácil (+60) de Sabiduría académica (Derecho)</strong> o un Chequeo <strong>Desafiante (+0) de Inteligencia</strong> les indicarán que es probable que pierdan el caso a menos que gasten un buen dinero en sobornos. Por supuesto, Phillipe alegará a gritos que solo se estaba defendiendo. Por desgracia, los dos cocheros y los demás pasajeros han visto a los PJs amenazar al jugador con violencia.</p>\n<p>Si lo dejan ir, Phillipe no les guardará rencor, ya que lo pillen haciendo trampas es un gaje del oficio al que está acostumbrado, por lo que se esfuerza al máximo para evitarlo. Si se le procesa, se enfadará mucho. Buscará vengarse lo antes posible y perseguirá sin descanso a los PJs sin importar adónde vayan.</p>\n<p>La forma que adopte la venganza de Phillipe y cuándo ocurra, depende de ti. Quizá contrate a una banda de ladrones para atacar a los PJs o los cace uno a uno cuando estén solos.</p>\n<p> </p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-eis/assets/set-pictures/coach-and-horses.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 1 - Wanted: Bold Adventurers","sort":100001},"cf":{"id":"temp_z9kf2wkio7e","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 1 - Wanted: Bold Adventurers","color":"#806128"}}}

The first Character into the shaft must make an <strong>Average (+20) Athletics</strong> Test to position the ladder and climb safely down on to the walkway.

{"_id":"kahbAL4tUYjxkbCp","name":"Festival Court and Stocks","content":"<p>The Festival Court is a large tent with the town’s coat of arms hanging outside. It is set up for the duration of the Schaffenfest to hear grievances that arise during the fair, and administer justice on the spot. Two Bögenhafen State Army halberdiers flank the entrance. They have orders only to admit those who have an interest in a particular case — generally the plaintiff, the defendant, and any witnesses. </p>\n<p>Inside the tent are two more halberdiers and Chief Magistrate @Actor[P3HlNMK6rubzDoxM]{Heinz Richter}, who hears a constant stream of petty cases all day. If the Characters happen to listen in to any of them, improvise any details required, perhaps using the @JournalEntry[l19TLyxqLCzCHgzx]{Random Encounters} as inspiration.</p>\n<p>Any Character accused of a crime, rightly or wrongly, is dragged to the Festival Court to be tried. The accused can either make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Charm</strong> Test or an <strong>Easy (+40) Lore (Law)</strong> Test to explain their side of the case, which is one step harder if the Character resisted arrest. The plaintiff then Opposes this with the same Test options. Richter will then make a judgement by making a <strong>Challenging (+0) Intuition</strong> Test. The winner of the <strong>Opposed</strong> Test between the defendant and plaintiff can then modify Richter’s final SL either up or down with their SL. If Richter ends up with a success (<strong>0+ SL</strong>), he determines the truth of what happened and makes the appropriate judgement. If Richter fails his Test, he instead gets the judgement wrong. </p>\n<p>Any Character found guilty of a crime is fined a sum between 1 and 20 Shillings, according to the nature of the crime. Characters who are unable to pay their fines are placed in one of the two sets of stocks until nightfall or until the stocks are needed for another prisoner — a period of [[/gmroll 1d10]] hours. Any Characters in the stocks are pelted with rotten fruit and worse, thrown by a small but enthusiastic crowd of urchins. The Character must pass a <strong>Very Easy (+60) Endurance</strong> Test every hour. The first failed Test gives the Character +1 <a></a>@Condition[Fatigued] Condition that is removed by a good night’s sleep in a bed. Any further failed Tests result in the loss of 1 Wound. <br /><br /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>As the Characters pass the Festival Court, a Halfling darts by and runs into the crowd. ‘<em>Stop him</em>!’ yells a soldier as he trips over his halberd and lands face-first in the mud. The Halfling — ‘Innocent’ Lowhaven — has Movement 3 with Athletics 39. If the Characters pursue him, use the Pursuit rules and set the initial Distance to 2. If caught, Innocent immediately gives up. If the Characters refuse his bribe of <a></a>@Pay[6ss]{6 shillings} to forget they saw him, he returns to the court with no complaint. ‘<em>Me, I’m Innocent, guv! An’ I never tell a lie.’ Richter supplies a reward of 1 shilling for his capture. Smiling, Innocent then remarks that, ‘I will not forget, or forgive, your part in this, mate!’<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li>‘’<em>Ere, mate, have you got any spare crap? We’ve run out for throwin’ at the criminibles. We ain’t got money or anyfin, but we’ll use it well!</em>’ The enterprising urchins aim to sell any offerings the Characters provide for <a></a>@Pay[1bp]{1d} to anyone looking to pelt those in the stocks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h4><strong>Key Scene: The Drunken Dwarf</strong></h4>\n<p>Passing by the stocks outside the Festival Court, the Characters find one of the two sets of stocks occupied by @Actor[x7MElaaMHCu8Jfzc]{Gottri Gurnisson}, a somewhat inebriated Dwarf. A small group of urchins taunts the unfortunate captive, throwing rotten fruit and various other objects at him.</p>\n<p>If anyone comes within earshot, Gottri begs pathetically to be lent the <a></a>@Pay[2ss]{2 shillings} he needs to pay his fine and be released. If any Character pays his fine, he will fawn drunkenly over his deliverer in a most embarrassing manner, swearing friendship for life and telling all and sundry what a good friend he  has found.</p>\n<p>After a little while, though, he turns the conversation to his favourite topic: drink and how he might come by the next one. Play this role to the hilt, stressing how crude, embarrassing, and foul-smelling the Dwarf is, and generally making the Characters regret having paid his fine. </p>\n<p>Those who join Gottri for a drink and try to learn his story, braving the hostile stares and muttered comments of everyone else in the beer tent, may learn that he was expelled from the Dwarven Engineers’ Guild for some invention that he cannot explain coherently, and that he has been drowing his sorrows ever since.</p>\n<p>The only way the Characters can rid themselves of Gottri is to give him enough money to buy himself a drink. If any Character does this (for any reason), the Dwarf immediately heads for the nearest beer tent without a thank-you, his face a fixed mix of determination and sadness. </p>\n<p>Later, there is a <a></a>@Roll[1d100]{20%} chance that Gottri is drinking his way through any beer tent the Characters encounter after the Dwarf is freed from the stocks, and a cumulative 10% chance that he is back in the stocks whenever they pass the Festival Court again.</p>\n<p>The Characters probably end up giving Gottri a small amount of money to buy a drink just to be rid of him. If they should decide to keep Gottri with them, you should arrange for him to slip off unseen towards the end of the day, since he appears later in the adventure in @JournalEntry[tPtznffIXCzCxMcm]{quite different circumstances}.</p>\n<p> </p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-eis/assets/set-pictures/gottri-gurnisson2.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Primary Locations","sort":200001},"cf":{"id":"temp_6s5iv6t92lp","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 6 - The Schaffenfest#/CF_SEP/Primary Locations","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"l19TLyxqLCzCHgzx","name":"Optional Encounters (Schaffenfest)","content":"<p>The optional encounters described here can be used as you see fit for your version of the Schaffenfest, and can be presented in any order. It is not necessary to use them all, and many work as well within the town as at the fair, so can be used later. Any encounters you decide not to use can easily be recycled into any town-based adventure.</p>\n<h3>Medicine Shows</h3>\n<p>There are several Medicine Shows dotted around the Schaffenfest. A blend of sideshow and stall, most are run by charlatans whose only concern is to make money by selling some worthless concoction as a panacea. Among the wares advertised by these rogues are, ‘Doctor Zeuss’s Wonder Tonic’, ‘Rare Elven Spirit Water’, and ‘Genuine Norscan Silver Talismans’. </p>\n<p>The properties claimed for these products are many and varied, such as ‘...<em>cures colic, rheumatics, warts, and bad breath</em>’, or ‘<em>keeps out the cold, evil spirits, and the neighbour’s cat.</em>..’ and so on. As far as these disreputable types go, the precise nature of the product, and the asking price (typically [[/r 2d10]] shillings), are left to your discretion. </p>\n<h4>Elvyra Kleinestun</h4>\n<p>There is one stall, owned by @Actor[Elvyra Kleinestun], where real herbal remedies can be acquired. The fact that most of them are useless unless applied by a Character with Heal Skill is beside the point! </p>\n<p>Any Character with Lore (Herbs or Plants), Trade (Apothecary or Herbalist) or any other Skill you deem relevant, realises her sales pitch isn’t nonsense, and can immediately identify her herbs as genuine.</p>\n<p>Elvyra is delighted to meet any Character who ‘<em>knows their herbs from cowdung</em>’. Although her goods sell for twice the normal price, she can be bargained down using the Haggle Skill. </p>\n<p>If she takes to the Characters, Elvyra suggests that if any of them ever wants to take up some ‘<em>serious pharmaceutical studies</em>’, they should visit her home in Weissbruck, where she can provide tuition. </p>\n<p>If that holds no interest to them, she says the Characters would be welcome to visit her anyway whenever they happen to be passing through the town. </p>\n<p>The party will have the opportunity to do just that, and to help her out of a tricky situation, in the next instalment of the campaign: <strong>Death on the Reik</strong>. Because of this, it is worth ensuring the Characters meet Elvyra. She is a good friend to have at the fair, especially if — or, more likely, when — one or more Characters needs medical attention. </p>\n<h3>Fortune Tellers</h3>\n<p>Clairvoyants, palmists, and self-proclaimed prophets generally set up shop in small, dimly-lit tents to tell fortunes for a small fee, generally between @Pay[5bp]{5}–@Pay[16bp]{16d}. The price varies not only from fortune teller to fortune teller, but also according to the fortune teller’s estimation of how much the customer can be persuaded to part with. The fortune telling may be done in a number of ways, including palmistry, cards, dice, crystal balls, tea leaves and more. Most fortune tellers employ a number of these methods, each with their corresponding props. Standard predictions concern meeting tall, dark strangers or going on long journeys, but a ‘genuine’ fortune teller may provide a Character with some useful information.</p>\n<h4>Mystic Megret</h4>\n<p>@Actor[dmmVkC0VqXRKmwrG]{‘Mystic Megret’} has been peering into the future all her life. Her prognostications, whilst not always immediately decipherable, even to herself, are almost always true. Having the party encounter her bright-red and yellow tent provides you with an opportunity to sow various hints and clues about what is going on in Bögenhafen. Depending on when the Characters hear them, Megret’s pronouncements may be useful, or they may simply help to build atmosphere. They likely mean nothing at the time, but when they come true the Characters, and the Players, are left with an uneasy feeling. The following are some of Megret’s sample predictions. Do not give them all at once, but allow the Characters to come back for more whenever they like, either as a group or individually.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I see a dark place. A narrow place, with water. There is death there.<br /></em>This refers to the sewer where @Actor[x7MElaaMHCu8Jfzc]{Gottri Gurnisson}’s body @JournalEntry[tPtznffIXCzCxMcm]{will be dumped}.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>Beware of a big man, a rich man. He will bring much danger. </em><br />This is a reference to @Actor[LG5qATEIFPE9bezB]{Johannes Teugen}.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>I see a dark man. He is not what he seems.</em><br />This refers to @Actor[IvvkdVTJzutEsrlX]{Gideon}, the Daemon summoned by Teugen.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>The sign of the rose is red, dripping blood.</em><br />A red rose, stylised into a cross, is the badge of the @JournalEntry[RuqDBFEu6BTWCKLw]{House of Teugen}.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>I see seven men, and two. One of the two will destroy the others, and many more besides.</em><br />The ‘seven men’ are the members of the Inner Council of the Ordo Septenarius. The ‘two’ are Johannes Teugen and Gideon.<br /><br />This final prediction should not be given until the adventurers have returned from the sewers after discovering Gottri Gurnisson’s body.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>The great killed the small, and the highest serve the lowest. You are in great danger. The Eye is upon you.</em><br />This is a cryptic reference to the fact that Teugen killed Gottri the Dwarf, and that the ruling classes of Bögenhafen are unwitting pawns of a Greater Daemon of the Chaos God Tzeentch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like her father before her, Megret is highly skilled at her profession. She could prove to be a useful mentor if there are any Characters looking to become mystics. Of course, if your party includes such a Character, Megret knows this already, and introduces herself.</p>\n<h3>Random Events</h3>\n<p>Either use any event listed here when you feel it is most appropriate, or randomly roll on this table whenever the Characters are  wandering the fair and little else is happening. If an event needs an NPC, use the generic Fairgoers Characteristics, listed as either @Actor[URUKE96IWJonCwms]{Burgher}, @Actor[eiV1ZJa609c5w3Z3]{Peasant}, @Actor[1gfSvtfgnizGaXWB]{Rogue}, or @Actor[eR95rwLF0gZUgRQs]{Warrior}.</p>\n<h4> </h4>\n<table style=\"height:272px;width:624px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:159px;height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>[[/r 1d100]]</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:458px;height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>Event/Encounter</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:159px;text-align:center\">01-04</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:458px;text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[rN8csui3CPMiYMIh]{Accusation}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:159px;text-align:center\">05-08</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:458px;text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[Tu1n838py1ithhMX]{Arrest}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:159px;text-align:center\">09-13</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:458px;text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[Bsi54x8qhW0KtA40]{Beer Tent}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:159px;text-align:center\">14-18</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:458px;text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[uic9rew9n94F1UmX]{Beggar}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:159px;text-align:center\">19-23</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:458px;text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[2e4r3XUJBQjrt0eL]{Bigotry}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:159px;text-align:center\">24-26</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:458px;text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[lTCo5nhc2yM90W1I]{Bodyguard}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:159px;text-align:center\">27-33</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:458px;text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[ywr30Ao4icyS9x6N]{Brawl}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:159px;text-align:center\">34-36</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:458px;text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[8xuIJTRlKL23NVbL]{Bunko Artist}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:159px;text-align:center\">37-43</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:458px;text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[u3Uc8IJmRxolFghZ]{Entertainer}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:159px;text-align:center\">44-46</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:458px;text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[q517NzyM1TtoFOGd]{Escaped Livestock}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:159px;height:17px;text-align:center\">47-52</td>\n<td style=\"width:458px;height:17px;text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[2xDqOHbJ9RNVlgEC]{Fair Games}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:159px;height:17px;text-align:center\">53-55</td>\n<td style=\"width:458px;height:17px;text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[XQrVPgqoFqHVSTjP]{Mercenaries}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:159px;height:17px;text-align:center\">56-90</td>\n<td style=\"width:458px;height:17px;text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[tTaLvyvcXrQkWBHb]{Vendor}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:159px;height:17px;text-align:center\">91-95</td>\n<td style=\"width:458px;height:17px;text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[Dnt7w9tejldGGYsn]{Thief}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:159px;height:17px;text-align:center\">96-00</td>\n<td style=\"width:458px;height:17px;text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[3La0g88NRajwBLU3]{Watch Patrol}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 6 - The Schaffenfest","sort":100001},"cf":{"id":"temp_7b2zg73jxz3","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 6 - The Schaffenfest","color":"#717315"}}}

{"_id":"marbCRAizx1tjBQ3","name":"The Boatman Inn","content":"<p>@Actor[nxLsH2WvU6xmjzfg]{Josef} eventually leads the adventurers down the Street of a Hundred Taverns to the river. All manner of vessels are tied up along the riverfront, from high-masted ships to smaller barges and houseboats. The Boatman Inn is just one of many establishments along the embankment. It appears to be a cheerful place; a little tatty, but inviting.</p>\n<p>A number of riverfolk are inside the inn. These are mostly boatmen, but there are a few sailors as well, in the city from the Reiksport. The atmosphere is cordial and friendly, and the food and drink is reasonably priced and of good quality. Josef orders as many bottles of wine as there are Characters in the party, plus one for himself; he is clearly in a mood for celebration. Then, he leads everyone to a table.</p>\n<p>No one takes very much interest in the party, and the early evening should pass pleasantly. Josef will pass on what rumours he knows and tell the Characters that he is looking for some hands for a journey to Bögenhafen, where he hopes to sell some Reikland wine at a fair and livestock market known as the @JournalEntry[CK4GguuIqzMioEq3]{The Schaffenfest}. This is one of the Reikland’s largest fairs and it attracts people from all walks of life from all across the surrounding area. Josef has a handbill advertising the fair (give the players @JournalEntry[lLyEwh6Xfc9p6cYU]{Handout 6: The Schaffenfest}), and points out that Graf Wilhelm von Saponatheim and the Grand Duke Leopold of Middenland may not be the only nobles there. The Characters may find other opportunities there to replace the promise of Prince Hergard von Tasseninck’s expedition.</p>\n<p>Josef will pay @Credit[2ss EACH]{2/-} per day for up to four Characters who sign on as crew, and is willing to transport the rest of the party free of charge. He is keen to leave at daybreak the next day, and offers to put the Characters up on his boat for the night before heading out down the Weissbruck Canal in the morning. </p>\n<p>Any Character that takes up Josef ’s offer to act as crew may immediately enter the Career for 0 XP. This is a one-time offer. If Characters wish to take up the opportunity later, it will cost the standard number of XP to do so as dictated  in <strong>WFRP</strong>.</p>\n<h3>The Man in Black</h3>\n<p>At some point while the Characters are enjoying themselves in the inn, a tall, gaunt man saunters into the room. He has aquiline features and a deep scar along his left cheek. Everyone in the inn turns to stare at him and he greets them with a sneer. The character is @Actor[HL4OH7owREPpGyA0]{Max Ernst}, a protagonist. As he walks across to the bar, the dim lights of the inn reflect dully from his black leather clothing. Patrons flinch visibly as Max passes their tables.</p>\n<p>Max demands a bottle of brandy from the landlord and throws a handful of coins on to the bar. He then walks over to a table in the corner of the room, whose occupants rapidly vacate it. Max sits down and drinks, but anyone who has spent any time in drinking establishments is in no doubt — the man in black is here to fight. If a fight does not present itself by the time he is finished drinking, he picks a suitable victim and starts a fight of his own.</p>\n<p>However, tonight is Max’s lucky night: a couple of young nobles are out on the town, determined to bait some commoners and then turn Max on to them. Max should be played to make the Characters feel uneasy; he does nothing overtly threatening at this stage, but there is a definitely an empty space around his table. Max stares coldly at anyone who summons up the courage to talk to him, but says nothing.</p>\n<h3>Hooray for Henry</h3>\n<p>A short while after Max’s arrival, or earlier if the adventurers look like they are preparing to leave, two young nobles and their four massive bodyguards enter the inn. ‘<em>I saaay, chaps! What a quaint establishment!</em>,’ they giggle to each other in high-pitched, aristocratic tones. One of them swaggers over to the bar and says, ‘<em>Two of your finest beverages, landlord</em>!’</p>\n<p>The two nobles are both already drunk, and giggle like children at the comments they pass back and forth between themselves about the inn, its patrons, and commoners in general. They are obnoxious and insulting to everyone in the inn, calling them ‘<em>filthy commoners</em>’ and ‘<em>smelly oicks</em>’. From their banter, one seems to be called @Actor[G7YJHGe4JkHvcNja]{Jacob} and the other @Actor[bur6uaXdENjetLwT]{Georg}.</p>\n<p>Before long, they start a drinking competition they call the ‘<em>brandy bounce</em>’, which involves gulping down pints of brandy and then throwing it up over anyone in the immediate vicinity. Unfortunately, one of their targets just happens to be one of the Characters (chosen at random). Both young nobles think this is great fun, but any commoner entertaining violent thoughts would likely have to deal with the four bodyguards, who are stone-cold sober and very mean.</p>\n<p>A successful <strong>Average (+20) Intuition</strong> Test allows the Characters to notice that Max clearly knows the bodyguards and is watching them closely, but is trying to hide this as he swigs his brandy. Josef attempts to restrain the Characters from violence, pointing out that it would not be wise to upset any noble household, particularly as the bodyguards look like they are itching for a fight. Leaving the inn is not easy as two of the bodyguards block the door. Should the Characters be unable to restrain themselves and make any move to attack, @Actor[HL4OH7owREPpGyA0]{Max Ernst} pushes his chair back and strides over to them, just as he has been employed to do. In a dry, rasping voice he says, <em>‘I wouldn’t if I were you, pea-brains. Why don’t you just sit there and enjoy yourself ?</em>’ The whole inn goes quiet as everyone waits for the Characters to reply. The young nobles step back behind their bodyguards, giggling and enjoying their merry jape. </p>\n<p>From here on Max takes over, pushing any Character attempting to get up back into their seat and offering choice insults such as: ‘<em>Why don’t you country bumpkins wash the swill off you before you enter a civilised city?’</em> Max will keep goading the Characters until they react physically, or until you feel the scene has gone on long enough. In the former case, Max attacks to disarm or stun his opponent — assuming a fair fight. If faced with more than one opponent, Max comments that it takes more than one village idiot to frighten him, and he begins to fight in earnest. Max is not really interested in killing, but will do so if faced by overwhelming numbers. He will get no help from the nobles or their bodyguards, who find the whole affair very amusing.</p>\n<p>After the fight, or if a fight is avoided, the nobles leave the inn laughing very loudly and head off for another establishment. Anyone attempting to follow them will have to deal with their four bodyguards.</p>\n<p>Inside the inn, the Characters are treated as heroes if they defeated Max, and do not pay for a drink for the rest of the evening. If they were defeated, the inn’s patrons gather round to commiserate with them. In either case, Max does not stay around. If victorious, he spits on his fallen opponents and stalks out looking even more dangerous than when he entered; if defeated, he slinks off into the night. If he was killed, a small group of locals sneak his body out of the inn in a blanket, and dump it into the river.</p>\n<p>Vengeful Characters may decide to follow Max outside and finish the matter on the waterfront. He turns and faces any pursuers, with a sarcastic comment on their courage if he is outnumbered, and fights to the death using every dirty trick at his disposal. Killing Max in this way will not gain the adventurers any admiration; although Max was far from popular, this is just another dockside murder rather than the honourable defeat of a local bully.</p>\n<h3>Bolts In The Dark</h3>\n<p>Leaving the inn, @Actor[nxLsH2WvU6xmjzfg]{Josef} leads the Characters to his barge. Along the way, the party becomes aware it is being followed. Any Character with the Talent notices this first; others clearly hear the sound of footsteps with a successful <strong>Easy (+40) Perception</strong> Test a few Rounds later. The Characters are being followed by the two cultists from the square, who in turn are being followed by @Actor[echM0Sjy5xpt5KAQ]{Adolphus Kuftsos}.</p>\n<p>This episode is not intended to make sense to the Players. Having prevented the ‘magister impedimentae’ from making contact with the Purple Hand’s Altdorf cell by misdirecting the two cultists when the coach arrived, the bounty hunter has decided to kill the cultists. </p>\n<p>He also intends to scare his true quarry — Kastor Lieberung, or the Character he has mistaken for the Chaos cultist — and drive the party away from Altdorf and on towards @JournalEntry[Bögenhafen]{Bögenhafen}, where his trap awaits and the ‘magister impedimentae’ can hopefully be separated from the rest of the group.</p>\n<p>The Characters will probably react to being followed, and may make a plan such as lying in wait for the cultists or trying to lose them down an alley.</p>\n<p>If they lie in wait, they see the two cultists suddenly cut down as a crossbow bolt slams into the back of one, and, as the other turns, another bolt thuds into his throat. The cultists die instantly and Adolphus — whom the Characters cannot see from their position — slips quietly away into the night. The Characters may be able to determine the rough direction from which the fatal bolts came, but there is no trail for them to follow and they cannot catch up to the unseen assassin.</p>\n<p>Unless they botch a crucial dice roll, if the Characters choose to lose the cultists in the alleys, they have little trouble doing so. When the Chaos cultists realise they have lost the ‘magister’ and his party, they head for Josef ’s boat, the Berebeli — Josef is well-known on the docks and the cultists have identified him as the ‘magister’s friend’. When the adventurers finally reach the barge they find the two bodies of the cultists slumped by the gangplank, with wounds in their back and neck that a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> or <strong>Average Ranged (+20)</strong> Test will reveal were made by crossbow bolts. Economical by nature, Adolphus retrieved his bolts after killing the cultists.</p>\n<p>If the adventurers ignore their followers or fail to notice them, they can simply go to the boat. The cultists will follow them, only to be shot from the shadows just as the last of the Characters sets foot on deck. They will not be able to tell exactly where the bolts came from, and have no realistic chance of picking up the bounty hunter’s trail.</p>\n<p>A search of the cultists’ bodies will yield two @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.ahlxlfIl8xUhBkic]{daggers} and @Credit[3ss19bp SPLIT]{3/19}. They carry no identification other than a small tattoo on the right breast, depicting a purple hand. These tattoos are not discovered unless the adventurers do a very thorough search — and an unpleasant one, as the personal hygiene of both cultists leaves a great deal to be desired!</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 3 - Heart of the Empire","sort":450001},"cf":{"id":"temp_3x0rt108klt","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 3 - Heart of the Empire","color":"#24592b"}}}

Beneath these two comes the Inner Council of seven members, none of whom has an inkling as to Gideon’s true nature. </p>\n<p>It is these seven whom Teugen plans to exchange for his own soul. The most important members of the council, for the purposes of this adventure, are @Actor[Coxv92EfL6VmlpCS]{Councillors Steinhäger} and @Actor[7rE1jYAeMNKfrgcQ]{Magirius}. The others are wealthy and influential citizens of the town, but their identities need not be determined unless you need to. There are also 49 rank-and-file members of the society — seven for each council member. These people know next to nothing about Gideon. They genuinely believe that the society provides a harmless meeting ground for well-intentioned merchants and is a worthy benefactor to many of the town’s deserving causes.</p>\n<h3>What's Really Going On?</h3>\n<p>The seven members of the Inner Council believe that the society has another purpose: Teugen has told them that he has the power to influence market forces by the use of sorcery. He convinces them that if they participate in a ceremony with him Bögenhafen will become the commercial and financial centre of the Empire, making them all untold fortunes. Little do they know that Teugen intends to sacrifice their souls to save his own.</p>\n<p>However, Teugen has been deceived in his turn. Gideon is a servant of the Chaos god Tzeentch. Far from saving Teugen’s soul, the ritual could in fact sacrifice the entire population of the town and create a minor Chaos Gate through which fresh hordes of Chaos creatures will pour. Then the Empire will be caught between the Chaos armies threatening Kislev in the north and those issuing forth from the newly created gate at Bögenhafen.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 5 - The False Inheritance","sort":425001},"cf":{"id":"temp_cl9zq7ae6vw","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 5 - The False Inheritance","color":"#7b5611"}}}

By the time they have evaded any pursuers and reached the docks, it will be sunset and Morrslieb is already high in the sky. As dusk falls, a green-lit mist creeps up from the river, thickening almost visibly as it moves over the docks. Soon, it is impossible to see the west bank of the river, and the Ostendamm stands in a sea of moon-lit mist almost 2ft deep.</p>\n<p>The Characters are likely interested in one of two locations on the Ostendamm: Warehouse 13 and Warehouse 17. If the Characters watch both warehouses, they soon realise that no activity is taking place at Warehouse 17, while several people are visiting Warehouse 13.</p>\n<h3>Warehouse 17</h3>\n<p>Warehouse 17 is closed up, and a faint, flickering light can be seen from inside. Over the warehouse, and those adjoining it, hangs the sign of an ear of corn held in a mailed fist — the sign of the Ruggbroder family.</p>\n<p>If the Characters enter the warehouse, they find it full of crates of bottled wine. The crates nearest the door have ‘Kronenwinzerei Altdorf ’ branded into the side. Having travelled to Bögenhafen with @Actor[Josef Quartjin], the Characters recognise the wine as being from the cargo he carried to the town. The party has just had time to realise that the warehouse is absolutely full, and that there is no possible space that could be used for a ritual, before it finds itself faced with @Actor[4JYaYJqgsJMnTDe3]{Big Georg}, a night watchman, and two savage guard dogs, @Actor[JJ0JRl5cYTTf5qjf]{Kaden} &amp; @Actor[okTRplvSsVqjWaJa]{Wrench}. The dogs attack immediately, and the watchman runs, shouting for the Watch. A four-man patrol will arrive on the scene in [[/gmr 1d10]] Rounds. If the Characters retreat, the night watchman calls the dogs off and closes up the warehouse again. He is concerned only with keeping the goods safe, and has no particular interest in bringing thieves to justice.</p>\n<h3>Warehouse 13</h3>\n<p>At dusk, @Scene[clYfG9LmEw1J5Kmo]{Warehouse 13} is quiet. Over the door hangs the rose-cross symbol of the Teugen family. The doors are not locked, and the Characters may look inside through the doors or through one of the barred windows that are set around the walls. An area at the front of the warehouse has been cleared, and crates are tightly packed in the rest of the warehouse. The crates are marked, ‘Silas Hillberry, Appleford,’ and contain bottled fruit.</p>\n<h4>Hiding in the Warehouse</h4>\n<p>If the Characters decide to hide in the warehouse and wait for something to happen, they will be able to find suitable hiding places amongst the crates. They can secure a reasonable view of the inside of the warehouse from their hiding-places, but you may call for an <strong>Average (+20) Stealth (Urban) </strong>Test from Characters who insist on moving about.</p>\n<h4>Watching the Warehouse</h4>\n<p>If the Characters choose to stay outside and watch from cover, they must find a suitable hiding-place. When anyone comes to the warehouse, they must each make an <strong>Easy (+40) Stealth (Urban)</strong> Test (it’s so easy because of the darkness, weird lighting from Morrslieb, and the mist); you should feel free to add any further modifiers that seem appropriate, depending on where the Characters choose to hide.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 9 - The Darkest Hour","sort":87500},"cf":{"id":"temp_n709dapcyhd","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 9 - The Darkest Hour","color":"#5e2522"}}}

There are various groups of people discussing the finer points of the sport in a pseudo-sophisticated manner, and any ‘commoners’ interrupting (likely including the Characters) are greeted with frosty looks. A royal pavilion, packed with nobles from across Reikland, is set up against the town wall before a long wooden barrier with a clump of circular tents at either end. Opposite the pavilion are wooden stands from which commoners can spectate. Various knights, squires, and men-at-arms are readying themselves among the tents, and two mounted knights are tilting at each other.</p>\n<p>The joust is between the extended retinue of Graf @Actor[KfVnMx7Bn1DWErM6]{Wilhelm von Saponatheim}, the local liege lord of this part of the Reikland, and that of Grand Duke Leopold of Middenland, who is visiting the Reikland with a significant group of retainers. It is not an open contest, so outside challengers are not welcome. Squires seeking employment with one of the knights receive a patronising rebuttal. Characters who stray from the commoner stands and are not obviously from the upper classes find themselves repeatedly moved on by the @Actor[nCzNGuS22drsDAIe]{Town Watch}, @Actor[eR95rwLF0gZUgRQs]{soldiers}, or household guards, and are insulted by drunken young rakes as well.

{"_id":"pXSQdRzX2VCa8zMG","name":"Adventuring In The Sewers","content":"<p>Bögenhafen has two types of shaft in its sewers: Major and Minor. </p>\n<p>Major sewers (shown by a heavy line on the sewer map) have two walkways, each 3ft wide, on either side of a 5ft wide effluent channel. The channel is usually some 5ft deep, and filled at least half-full with the worst Bögenhafen has to offer. The curved ceiling reaches 10ft above the walkways at its highest point. The walkways are only wide enough to allow Characters to proceed in single file.</p>\n<p>Minor sewers (shown by a narrow line on the @Scene[o2rtweOR2Yq5q797]{sewer map}) are simple pipes, 5ft in diameter with a sewage flow normally about a foot deep. These are relatively easy, though smelly, to negotiate.</p>\n<p>There are two types of junctions in the sewer system. Where a minor sewer flows into a major sewer, the junction is beneath the walkway and the walkway is not interrupted. Where two major sewers meet, the walkway is interrupted, requiring the Adventurers to improvise a bridge of some kind or to make a leap of 5ft to cross.</p>\n<h3>Movement In The Sewers</h3>\n<p>There is effectively no risk involved in moving along the sewers at Walking speed. Any Character moving faster must succeed with a <strong>Challenging (+0) Athletics</strong> Test (taken as a Free Action) before taking the extra Movement, or fall into the effluent.</p>\n<p>Characters who wish to cross the effluent channel must leap or wade. Because of the cramped conditions, there is only room for a run-up if the Character runs diagonally across the effluent channel, a leap of 4 yards. If the Test is failed, the Character falls into the effluent channel. </p>\n<p>Characters wading in the sewage flow must take an Athletics Test before their Turn in Combat (or every minute outside Combat) in order to avoid slipping and falling over. Characters who wish to go along minor sewers must wade.</p>\n<h3>Getting Mucky</h3>\n<p>It is quite possible that Characters will fall into, or wade through, the sewage. The sewage-drenched halve all Fellowship-based Tests until they clean themselves and their clothing. Only Characters shorter than 4ft run any risk of drowning if they fall in the effluent channel of a major sewer. Roping the Characters together avoids this.</p>\n<h4>Infected Wounds</h4>\n<p>The sewers are unsanitary, to say the least. After any encounter where a Character suffers any Wound loss while in the sewers (other than those suffered from Falling) each affected Character must succeed at an <strong>Easy (+40) Endurance</strong> Test or gain a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.1hQuVFZt9QnnbWzg]{Minor Infection}; if this Test is an <strong>Impressive Failure</strong> (<strong>−4 SL</strong>) or worse, the Character instead suffers a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.kKccDTGzWzSXCBOb]{Festering Wound}. </p>\n<p>Further, if a Character should suffer a Critical Wound when in the sewers, even if Critical Deflection is used, a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance </strong>Test must be attempted. On a success, the Character gains a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.1hQuVFZt9QnnbWzg]{Minor Infection}. On a failure, the Character instead develops a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.kKccDTGzWzSXCBOb]{Festering Wound}.</p>\n<h4>Diseases</h4>\n<p>As long as the Characters stay out of the effluent, they are likely to escape the sewers without contracting something nasty. However, it is quite different should they take a dip. Exposure to the sewage comes in two forms: Wading, and Immersed. </p>\n<p>Wading is moving through the effluent, but keeping your head above the muck. Immersed means your head has gone under.</p>\n<p>After every half an hour, or part thereof, of Wading, take an <strong>Average (+20) Endurance</strong> Test. If passed, nothing happens, beyond being rather soiled. If failed, the Wading Character contracts @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.UAwTqZ3hqNb7vq9s]{Itching Pox}. </p>\n<p>If Immersed, take a <strong>Difficult (−10) Endurance</strong> Test. If passed, nothing beyond the horror of a sewage-dunking happens. On a <strong>Marginal Failure (−0 SL),</strong> the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.UAwTqZ3hqNb7vq9s]{Itching Pox} is contracted. On a <strong>Failure (−2 SL)</strong>, contract the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.txeLd7R13qxSvmsr]{Galloping Trots}. On an <strong>Impressive Failure (−4 SL)</strong> or worse, the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.herUmN51D9TiL2Vn]{The Bloody Flux} is contracted. </p>\n<h3>Sight, Sound, and Smell</h3>\n<p>The sewers are unlit. Even Characters with the Talent cannot see unless they carry a source of light such as a torch or a lantern. </p>\n<p>Sound echoes and carries for twice as far as normal in the sewers, so there is a +10 modifier to all sound-based Perception Tests. </p>\n<p>Lastly, the smell in the sewers is, to say the least, unpleasant. Upon entering the sewers, all Characters must succeed at an <strong>Average (+20) Endurance</strong> Test or suffer the effects of the @Symptom[Nausea] Symptom until they leave the sewers.

A los cocheros no se les ve por parte alguna, siguen en la cama durmiendo la mona. A las nueve en punto se hace evidente que no van a aparecer: una rápida mirada a la diligencia muestra que ni siquiera la han preparado para el viaje. Despertar a los cocheros es fácil; pero conseguir que mantengan una conversación inteligible, no. Ambos tienen una resaca antológica y sólo hablan en murmullos.

Esto plantea una nueve serie de problemas: sólo pueden viajar con comodidad en el interior seis personas.

Los cocheros no están para discutir; suben vacilantes a sus puestos y se sientan, agarrándose la cabeza, sin prisa para salir, al parecer.</p>\n<p>Los PJs que estén dispuestos a desafiar a los elementos pueden viajar en el techo: ningún PNJ estará de acuerdo en hacerlo. Tratar de meter más pasajeros se encontrará con una gran resistencia de la dama Isolda, que amenazará con represalias por parte de sus parientes más importantes en Altdorf. Intentar que los cocheros les devuelvan lo pagado por los pasajes es imposible: ya se han gastado el dinero, lo que queda patente por su estado actual.</p>\n<p>La situación puede resolverse de varias maneras. Un PJ podría ganarse a la dama con una canción o un recital adecuado (con un Chequeo de <strong>Animar</strong> o <strong>Tocar</strong>) o utilizar una Habilidad como <strong>Carisma</strong>. <strong>Nota:</strong> cuando se trata de la dama Isolda, todos los Chequeos de Carisma de los PJs de la categoría Plata o Bronce sufren un penalizador -10 (ver @JournalEntry[ze7hFXPbeBcRDk03]{El Estatus Social}). Si no consiguen ganarse a la dama Isolda, los aventureros que no quepan en la diligencia deberán viajar en el techo.</p>\n<p>Si el grupo considera la posibilidad de esperar a la próxima diligencia, Gustav les informará de que no hay ninguna prevista hasta dentro de dos días, y es probable que vaya tan llena como ésta. <em>‘¡La anterior iba muy llena! Estaban amontonados en el techo, y unos cuantos también colgaban a los lados...’.</em></p>\n<p>En el improbable caso de que los PJs logren ganarse a la dama Isolda y se metan en la diligencia, ésta se arrepentirá muy pronto y les ordenará que salgan. Si salen, todo irá bien: si no, la dama Isolda estará de muy mal humor durante todo el viaje y sólo hablará para espetar a sus compañeros de viaje un insulto bien elegido.</p>\n<h3>Un pequeño retraso</h3>\n<p>Cuando todos los pasajeros están listos, los cocheros ya no están preparados para salir. @Actor[ND9BHKtUxtQqty7w]{Uno} se encierra en el retrete de la posada y no se le puede convencer de que abra la puerta durante veinte minutos al menos. Los sonidos y los olores que proceden del interior son harto desagradables.</p>\n<p>Al @Actor[uzWAvJDoBl0osDnW]{otro cochero} se le oye roncar con suavidad desde el asiento que ocupa en la parte superior de la diligencia. Si los PJs deciden robar la diligencia, tendrán que lidiar con los indignados pasajeros y, a su debido tiempo, los guardas de caminos los buscarán. Si los atrapan, ¡llegarán a tener verdaderos problemas!.</p>\n<h3>Comienza el viaje</h3>\n<p>Al final, los cocheros están listos para comenzar el viaje y arrearán a los caballos para que vayan a paso lento, unas 2 millas por hora. Si les mandan ir más rápido, los cocheros azotarán a los caballos, pero pronto los obligarán a ir más despacio. A esta velocidad, el movimiento de la diligencia es un balanceo lento y suave que es cómodo para las cabezas doloridas de los cocheros, pero es obvio que la diligencia no llegará a la posada siguiente ¡antes de que oscurezca!.</p>\n<p>Si un PJ se ofrece a tomar las riendas, los cocheros no se opondrán. Estarán más que felices de acurrucarse y dormir para no tener resaca mientras otro hace el trabajo. Cualquier PJ con la Habilidad Conducir puede llevar la diligencia bastante rápido; si no la tiene, deberá pasar un Chequeo <strong>Normal (+20) de Conducir</strong> o el viaje se hará algo más lento. Si un PJ falla por -2 NE o más, el carruaje chocará contra una roca u otro obstáculo y se desprenderá una rueda. La diligencia se precipitará peligrosamente a la cuneta, todos los pasajeros sufrirán daño y el sobresalto despertará a cualquier cochero dormido.</p>\n<p>Se necesita un total de al menos 100 puntos de Fuerza (por ejemplo, 4 PJS con una Fuerza de 25 cada uno) y conseguir un Chequeo <strong>Desafiante (+0) de Fuerza</strong> para enderezar la diligencia. Cada PJ que ayude añadirá +10 al Chequeo para enderezar el vehículo (ver @JournalEntry[mmTJkPx8kuUSUJjx]{Asistencia}). Por suerte, la rueda desprendida no está dañada. Volver a ponerla requiere pasar un Chequeo <strong>Normal (+20) de Conducir</strong> o un Chequeo <strong>Muy fácil (+60) de Oficio (carpintero)</strong> y 10 minutos de tiempo.</p>\n<h4>Gotas de lluvia que al caer...</h4>\n<p>La diligencia se pone de nuevo en marcha y, unos veinte minutos después,comienza a llover. Las primeras gotas pronto se convierten en un aguacero que empapa con rapidez a los PJs que viajan en el exterior.</p>\n<p>La dama Isolda se opone con vehemencia a que los plebeyos mojados entren. Marie, la guardaespaldas, hace cumplir dicho deseo. Tratar de entrar en la diligencia mientras ésta se mueve requiere lograr un Chequeo <strong>Complicado (-10) de Atletismo</strong> para descolgarse, seguido de un Chequeo <strong>Muy fácil (+60) de Fuerza </strong>para abrir la puerta. Si no se consigue descolgar, el PJ caerá al suelo y sufrirá una caída de 2 yardas, más un daño adicional de [[/r 1d10]] por la velocidad a la que se mueva el vehículo, por un total de [[/r 2d10+6]] de daño (ver @JournalEntry[wrRuiPttWVh7OXA2]{Caer}). El conductor se detendrá por cualquier aventurero que se caiga.</p>\n<p>Se permite repetir los intentos de entrar en la diligencia, pero cualquiera que lo logre se verá pateado por Marie, que usa la Habilidad <strong>Cuerpo a cuerpo (pelea)</strong> enfrentada a un Chequeo <strong>Complicado (-10) de Esquivar </strong>o de <strong>Cuerpo a cuerpo (pelea)</strong>. Si acierta, resuelve el Daño de la forma normal; y además el PJ golpeado también deberá lograr un Chequeo <strong>Desafiante (+0) de Fuerza</strong> para evitar caerse al camino. Los Personajes que eviten la patada se abrirán paso a la fuerza al interior de la diligencia, donde se producirá una refriega. Todos los PNJs que haya dentro harán lo posible para echar a empujones a los empapados PJs. Luchar en la diligencia con cualquier cosa menos con puños o dagas conlleva un penalizador -20 al ataque.</p>\n<p>Los cocheros no toman parte en esta pelea a menos que los PJs empiecen a dañar la diligencia (por ejemplo, intentando cortar el techo), en cuyo caso, les dirán que paren. Si esto no funciona, el cochero amenazará con el trabuco y disparará a cualquier PJ que no se detenga; sin embargo, este disparo sólo funciona con una tirada de impacto par (como 24 o 32) debido a la lluvia. Si se saca un número impar, como 23 o 35, habrá que recargar el trabuco en un lugar seco para poder volver a disparar con él. <strong>Nota:</strong> disparar el trabuco es el último recurso, porque el ruido retumbará en la resaca de Gunnar y Hultz y les causará casi tanto dolor como el que el disparo inflija a los aventureros!.</p>\n<h4>La encrucijada</h4>\n<p>Para de llover al cabo de un par de horas. Al fin, la diligencia llega a la encrucijada con la carretera principal que va de Middenheim a Altdorf. Un poste al lado del camino indica: ‘Altdorf, 120 millas’.</p>\n<p>En la encrucijada hay una casa de postas llamada <em>La Logia de los Cinco Hermanos</em>, que es propiedad de la compañía @JournalEntry[wVPKOC48Odm7JJMQ]{Cuatro Estaciones}. La diligencia del grupo no tiene parada aquí, pero –si los PJs insisten en bajarse– hay una espera de dos horas antes de que llegue la siguiente diligencia, que está llena y no para. La siguiente diligencia llega en otras cuatro horas. Tiene espacio para que los aventureros viajen en el techo a un precio de @Pay[10cp]{10cp} por cada uno. De todas maneras para los PJs, pronto se encontrarán con algo desagradable en el camino.</p>\n<p> </p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-eis/assets/set-pictures/Coachman-1024x476.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 1 - Wanted: Bold Adventurers","sort":150001},"cf":{"id":"temp_z9kf2wkio7e","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 1 - Wanted: Bold Adventurers","color":"#806128"}}}

They look no different from anyone else in the crowd, but they act strangely. While one watches the crowd, the other scratches his left ear with the little finger of his right hand. As he does so, he stares straight at the person he believes to be Kastor Lieberung. This action is repeated a number of times, each more pronounced than the last. This episode should be played for laughs, with the scratching routine becoming more and more exaggerated, and the two men looking more and more perturbed as the adventurers fail to respond as expected.</p>\n<p>The two men are cultists, and both are aware of Lieberung’s mission. They have been instructed to make contact with him by their branch of the Purple Hand. They have the magister’s description, but have never met him. To identify themselves, they use one of the cult’s secret codes; the left ear scratched by the little finger of the right hand. </p>\n<p>The correct response to this secret code is a slight raising of the eyebrows and the brushing back of one’s hair with the left hand. If the adventurers try to approach them or call out to them, the cultists look worried and retreat. Something is obviously wrong — maybe they have met the wrong person? It is extremely unlikely the Characters will provide the correct counter-signal, but if they do, it simply adds to the comic misunderstanding.</p>\n<h3>The Bounty Hunter</h3>\n<p>After a few failed attempts to elicit the right response, the cultists’ expressions suddenly change from confusion to relief. They hurry over to where a stocky man stands near a doorway to a house. They follow him through the door, which is shut behind them too quickly for the Characters to follow. The man is @Actor[echM0Sjy5xpt5KAQ]{Adolphus Kuftsos} the bounty hunter.</p>\n<p>It is important that the Characters see Adolphus at this point, and he appears whether or not the party tries talking to the cultists. The bounty hunter has been watching the square for Kastor’s arrival. Adolphus has seen the cultists attempting to make contact. Having some knowledge of the Purple Hand and its codes, Kuftsos gave the cultists the correct counter-signal when the Characters were looking away from him, and the cultists have fallen for his deception.

Of course, if the ritual was successfully completed, the town will be destroyed and the Characters must flee for their lives along with the rest of the populace. Otherwise, thanks to Gideon, the Characters are wanted by the Watch for the murder of Freidrich Magirius, and also for arson. </p>\n<p>Further, if they attempted to halt the ritual and in the process killed Teugen, Steinhäger, or any of the other members of the Inner Council, they are soon wanted for their murders, too. Even if the warehouse catches fire and all the bodies are burnt, the disappearance of Teugen and company is still noted and the Characters are the obvious suspects. One way or another, it is time to leave town. </p>\n<p>Probably as wanted criminals.</p>\n<h4>Convincing the Authorities</h4>\n<p>If Teugen fled Warehouse 13 during the ritual and was claimed by the burning Eye outside its walls, this terrible end was possibly witnessed by others in the town, perhaps including @Actor[pzFQiFUKm7yWhrsL]{Reiner Goertrin}, the Watch Captain, or one of his many representatives.</p>\n<p>Should Teugen’s inevitable downfall be seen by others, it is much easier for the Characters to convince the remaining authorities — and, more importantly, the Watch — of the whole story regarding the Daemon in the Hidden Temple and horrific events that followed this discovery. </p>\n<p>If this happens, the Characters are taken to the Watch barracks and interviewed by Captain Goertrin. After listening to their story, he will let them go. He also suggests the Characters keep their mouths shut if they don’t want to be pursued by Witch Hunters. The Captain has decided to cover up Bögenhafen's shame.</p>\n<p>Of course, if the ritual was stopped in a manner that means the town remains largely unaware of the affair, the Characters will still be hunted as dangerous criminals.</p>\n<h3>Fleeing Town</h3>\n<p>Most likely, the Characters have defeated Teugen and saved Bögenhafen, but are now on the run as wanted criminals.</p>\n<h4>The Town Gates</h4>\n<p>Attempts to exit through any of the town gates prove impossible unless the Characters come up with a good scheme. The Watch are searching for them and all gates are guarded by watchmen and State Army soldiers. To get through, the Characters might adopt a disguise or try bribery. However, the latter approach is expensive, as entire squads of watchmen and soldiers need to be bribed successfully.</p>\n<h4>The River</h4>\n<p>Escaping by river is possible if @Actor[Josef Quartjin] is still around. The <em>Berebeli </em>is being watched, but not carefully. Josef can move his barge to a suitable place where he can pick up the Characters. To keep the excitement high, a patrol of watchmen could appear and chase the party as it clambers aboard.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the Characters may decide to steal a rowing boat or riverboat. This shouldn’t be too difficult, but there is always the chance that the owner is on board.</p>\n<h4>The Crossed Pikes</h4>\n<p>If the Characters have already made friends with @Actor[sElqSPHULTbnUjf2]{Franz Baumann}, they may decide to go to him for help. Franz could put them up in @JournalEntry[pb4RWXHJMUXmHhTD]{The Crossed Pikes} until the heat is off (one week). This costs @Pay[4gc]{4 GC} each, but after a week the Characters are able to slip out of the town without too much bother.</p>\n<h4>Avoiding the Watch</h4>\n<p>If you don’t want to extend this last part of the adventure, you could simply allow the Characters to slip out of town unnoticed. However, if they are blatant or stupid in their attempts to leave, you may like to have a Watch patrol chase them through the streets of Bögenhafen for a while.</p>\n<h3>Trips on the Reik</h3>\n<p>The campaign continues in the next part, <strong>Death On the Reik</strong>. The next stage of the campaign initally sees them head for Weissbruck after securing a barge, possibly to visit the herbalist @Actor[Elvyra Kleinestun]. But there are many other reasons to head to the rivers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Characters have the letter from @JournalEntry[eiuxOcHqsnpkM39a]{Etelka Herzen}, pointing them toward Nuln and the Black Peaks.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The bounty hunter @Actor[echM0Sjy5xpt5KAQ]{Adolphus Kuftsos} was active in both places, and the adventurers may want to know what he was up to. They may be able to track down his hired thugs @Actor[rYlDGJx20M72PydJ]{Bengt}, @Actor[r5NgPWpDHpjRkGQM]{Gurt}, and @Actor[BLrqbYcSiVvWnmws]{Willi} in @JournalEntry[3eKYpGCvUVuC8YFQ]{Weissbruck}, or try to find his mysterious informant Q.F.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Foolhardy Characters may choose to return to Altdorf despite probably being wanted there for the @JournalEntry[D5FkUrwpwDQkVMRK]{murder of a young noble}, thinking they have a good chance of escaping detection in the teeming metropolis.  It is still the Empire’s capital, and its streets are said to be paved, if not with gold, then at least with golden opportunities.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>If the Characters are still on good terms with @Actor[Josef Quartjin], they may decide to keep working as crew on the <em>Berebeli </em>while they decide on their next move. Having sold his cargo in Bögenhafen, Josef is heading back toward Weissbruck with a fresh cargo of local wine — or, if the worst has happened, a bargeload of terrified refugees.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Having  hopefully  foiled a Chaos cult in Bögenhafen, the Characters may have decided to embrace their role in the fight against the enemy within, and decided to track down and destroy the cult of the Purple Hand. Its agents were last seen in Altdorf, making it the most logical place to pick up the cult’s trail.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, Players are full of surprises, and the party may decide to go in the wrong direction. A rumour of black plague, backed up by an encounter with diseased refugees, should be enough to discourage that. </p>\n<p>Whatever they choose to do, the <strong>Enemy in Shadows</strong> has been revealed, and this part of the campaign is concluded.

{"_id":"t41YcSgaT3tIFkZk","name":"Options: Blow a Different Trumpet","content":"<p>Veteran Players will likely remember Adolphus is staying at the Trumpet Inn. There are several ways for you to present this section differently.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>It’s a Trap!</h3>\n<p>The Characters have only found out that the bounty hunter is staying at the Trumpet Inn because he wants them to know. He has taken a room in the inn, but it is booby-trapped in various imaginative ways. He and his hired thugs are watching the inn. They follow the Characters inside, ready to ambush them as they emerge, wounded and empty-handed, from the trapped room.</p>\n<h3>No Such Address</h3>\n<p>Adolphus has bribed various regulars of the Black Gold and the Happy Man to direct anyone who asks after him to the Trumpet. He has told some that he expects some business associates to enquire for him, and others that he is playing a practical joke on some friends. No one in either inn knows where he is really staying.</p>\n<h3>The Long and Winding Road</h3>\n<p>The Trumpet Inn is another blind, just like the Black Gold and the Happy Man. Adolphus is actually staying in a warehouse on the dockside from which he can keep an eye on the Berebeli. Bengt, Gurt, and Willie, his hired gang of local thugs, are with him.

{"_id":"uQ1sgSTE6W2Gwlgk","name":"Hidden Temple","content":"<p>The Mutant Goblin’s trail ends at a stout wooden door set into the wall of the sewer. There is a small opening with iron bars at about eye height, through which can be dimly seen a large cellar. A smoky torch burns in a wall bracket, casting flickering shadows around the room. Traces of green-black Goblin blood are found on the iron bars. A successful <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test reveals a bare Goblin footprint halfway up  the door. </p>\n<p>Any Character with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.mNoCuaVbFBflfO6X]{Sixth Sense} Talent or a Channelling Skill feels distinctly uneasy about this place, but is unable to say why. Any Character with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight} Talent can see traces of dhar — roiling, tainted black magic — in the chamber, but is not able to detect anything further. Characters with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.Nj3tC8A5fZ3zEdMR]{Holy Visions} Talent can feel the influence of the Dark Gods in the room ahead. The @JournalEntry[BRCzUptEKAlTMa6a]{<strong>(TB 4, D 12)</strong>} is bolted on the inside. Lying on the floor by the door is a pile of broken and chewed bones, the only identifiable one being a three-socketed pelvis…</p>\n<p>By entering or bringing light into the cellar, the Characters can see the stone-lined room is a temple of some kind. A large octagram is painted on the floor in dark-blue paint and a silver candlestick bearing an unlit black candle is positioned at each point. An engraved circle of copper, about 3 inches thick and 15ft in diameter, lies inside the octagram.</p>\n<p>In the centre of the copper ring, a seven-pointed star with a beast’s head and the words ‘Ordo Septenarius’ is written. The beast’s head is partly obscured by a large, dark stain (the Goblin’s blood).</p>\n<p>An iron cabinet stands against the back wall and a small pool of a dark liquid has collected on the floor in front of it. In the far corner (in front of a secret door) lies a large, silk handkerchief embroidered with the monogram — ‘F.S.’</p>\n<p>The Characters barely have time to take all this in — the bones, the octagram, the cabinet, the scrap of cloth (@Actor[Coxv92EfL6VmlpCS]{Franz Steinhäger}’s handkerchief ) — before a stream of thick, foul-smelling, black smoke flecked with blue and pink suddenly begins to issue from the centre of the octagram. The smoke rapidly coalesces into a horned, fang-filled creature with multiple glowing eyes, four beclawed arms, and multiple lash-like tongues. The entity howls as it coalesces, and magical energies whip out in all directions, lighting the room in blue and pink coruscating light. A Daemon. Any Characters succeeding at a <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Theology)</strong> or <strong>Easy (+40) Lore (Chaos)</strong> Test will recognise this as a manifested Horror of Tzeentch, a servant of the Chaos God of Magic and Change.</p>\n<p>The Daemon does not attack the Characters immediately. Though still struggling with the material plane, it has quickly grown fond of its new physical existence, and particularly enjoyed eating the Goblin. It is bound to protect the Hidden Temple, and recognises that it cannot do so if destroyed, so violence is its last option, not its first. So, it gibbers on the spot, hissing and roaring to frighten the Characters away as pink energies run along the length of its disturbing body as new eyes, mouths, and tentacles sprout and disappear on its head. </p>\n<p><strong>Cool</strong> Tests to resist the Fear and Intimidation attempts are required. If this doesn’t cause the Characters to flee or attack, the Daemon reluctantly attempts to talk with them. It speaks Language (Daemonic), but is somehow understood. It explains that it can’t let the Characters stay, and that it tried to explain this to the three-legged thing, but it wouldn't listen. </p>\n<p>So, it ate it. It claims that if the Characters do not leave, it will summon more Daemons to drive them away. This is a bluff, but the Characters have no way of knowing this. The Daemon does everything in its power to make the party retreat.</p>\n<p>If the Characters destroy the Daemon, they can explore the room. The cabinet is locked @JournalEntry[BRCzUptEKAlTMa6a]{(TB 3, W 5)}.

{"_id":"wA6nLarpmxL4anFk","name":"Visiting The Schaffenfest","content":"<p>Our Heroes, having found the inheritance was a sham, likely need some cheering up. Fortunately, one of the Reikland’s largest festivals is happening just a stone’s throw away:  the Schaffenfest!</p>\n<h2>Visiting The Schaffenfest</h2>\n<p>Every spring, folk from across the Reikland flock to Bögenhafen for @JournalEntry[CK4GguuIqzMioEq3]{The Schaffenfest}. As well as the extensive livestock market, there are scores of stalls and sideshows of all kinds, making the three-day fair a great attraction and a highlight of the town’s calendar. The area between the East Gate and Postern Gate is crowded with livestock pens, market stalls, and sideshows of every description, and the air rings with the cries of entertainers and hawkers. </p>\n<p>Whether or not the Characters go in search of the lawyers’ office first, they will likely want to visit the Schaffenfest. Josef lets them know that he will be there to attend to his business. Although the Characters may plan to seek their fortunes elsewhere, they are stuck in Bögenhafen for at least a day or two, and the fair is a good way to pass time while they arrange new transport. Besides, everyone also knows a fair is a good place to find employment. A pouch of coins from an odd job bodyguarding or delivering goods helps finance travel plans. If they are particularly lucky they may come across a local noble who is planning an expedition like the one they missed in Altdorf. All things considered, there is no reason to be anywhere else.  Josef (or any passer-by) can give directions to the Schaffenfest: </p>\n<p>‘<em>Turn left on to the Hafenstrasse and keep goin’ straight on to the East Gate. You can’t miss it!’ </em>The streets are decorated with coloured bunting, and the main flow of the crowds is eastwards to the fair. The party is soon surrounded by happy, laughing festival-goers, all eager to enjoy what the Schaffenfest has to offer.</p>\n<h3>Running the Schaffenfest</h3>\n<p>The Characters can roam the Schaffenfest at their own pace, exploring the fair’s attractions and getting into various kinds of trouble depending upon how they react to the fair’s many attractions. In the midst of doing this, there are two Key Scenes that must happen for the adventure to proceed, preferably in the following order.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Key Scene: The Drunken Dwarf </strong>— The Characters notice the drunken Dwarf in the stocks outside the @JournalEntry[kahbAL4tUYjxkbCp]{Festival Court}</li>\n<li><strong>Key Scene: The Runaway Goblin</strong> — The Characters witness the escape of a three-legged Mutant Goblin from Doctor Malthusius’s @JournalEntry[0wES4ZYwCtJDuaU8]{Zoocopeia}.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The party can wander the Schaffenfest freely, enjoying one of the best festivals the Empire has to offer. To help you bring it to life, this chapter presents a selection of @JournalEntry[l19TLyxqLCzCHgzx]{Optional Encounters} to use as you wish, and also describes five @JournalEntry[lQUUjQrhtfq6hcdD]{Primary Locations} representing places important to the adventure or the festival. Included in the Primary Locations are the two Key Scenes you must present for the adventure to progress. Each Primary Location also offers two optional encounters you can use as you see fit. </p>\n<p>Your task in this part of the adventure is to bring the noisy, crowded, bustling fairground to life as the Characters explore the stalls and sideshows, interacting with the events and interesting NPCs, just as people do at a real fair. Describe the atmosphere, including the great mixture of folk brushing shoulders with each other, from dirty beggars to well-dressed artisans, from brightly-clothed entertainers to sombre-looking watchmen — the entire spectrum of Bögenhafen’s populace is represented. There are labourers singing loudly and out of tune (having over-indulged themselves at one of the beer tents), babies crying, pedlars hawking their wares, all interwoven with the general hubbub of people enjoying themselves.</p>\n<h3>The Watch</h3>\n<p>@JournalEntry[CK4GguuIqzMioEq3]{The Schaffenfest} is too large for the @Actor[nCzNGuS22drsDAIe]{Bögenhafen Watch} to patrol alone, so many temporary recruits are drafted in to support the State Army soldiers that keep the peace. Because of this, very few are actually good at their job.</p>\n<p>The response to someone calling out for the Watch is slow during the busy fair, so it normally takes 2 to 20 ([[/gmroll 2d10]]) minutes for a patrol to arrive. Profiles for the Watch: @Actor[4RZRWe2dSK8hA9OZ]{Bögenhafen Watch Recruits} @Actor[nCzNGuS22drsDAIe]{Bögenhafen Watchman} @Actor[opX8C6mLOuvFvV0B]{Bögenhafen Watch Sergeant}.</p>\n<h4>Arrested!</h4>\n<p>If any of the party are stopped under suspicious circumstances, arrest can be avoided with a Simple <strong>Challenging (+0) Charm</strong> Test. Alternatively, Characters can bribe the Watch. The price of their cooperation usually varies from 2 to 20 Silver ([[/gmroll 2d10]]), depending on the nature of the party’s indiscretion. If a patrol leader cannot be swayed (or bribed), the Characters are arrested.</p>\n<p>Should the Characters resist arrest with violence, the Watch respond in kind. Such behaviour is clear proof of guilt, and there is no point risking injury to valuable watchmen by attempting to take the offenders alive. The Watch use whistles to summon reinforcements, and the Characters may find themselves outnumbered unless they are able to flee the situation.</p>\n<h4>You’re Nicked, Sunshine!</h4>\n<p>Those arrested in the Schaffenfest are subject to a different @JournalEntry[3Soi2oRKzGkAdroB]{legal procedure} from the rest of the town. Because the fair is largely composed of travelling people, it can be difficult to obtain witnesses, so a special @JournalEntry[kahbAL4tUYjxkbCp]{Festival Court} is convened to deal swiftly with all disputes and petty crimes arising from the fair. For the course of this adventure, the sitting magistrate is Chief Magistrate @Actor[P3HlNMK6rubzDoxM]{Heinz Richter}. This court is somewhat more lenient than the normal court, and hands out judgement and punishments on the spot.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-eis/assets/set-pictures/schaffenfest.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 6 - The Schaffenfest","sort":1},"cf":{"id":"temp_7b2zg73jxz3","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 6 - The Schaffenfest","color":"#717315"}}}

Any encounters with the Watch should be frightening rather than dangerous, and the Characters should be able to shake off any pursuit fairly easily, but do not let the Players know this. </p>\n<p>Every time the Characters turn a corner while evading pursuit, you should have them make an <strong>Average (+20) Stealth (Urban) </strong>Test, based on the lowest score in the party; if the Test is failed, their pursuers are still on their tail, and are drawing ever closer. When a Test succeeds, the Characters manage to shake off the pursuit. The Players should be aware that the adventure is reaching its climax, and that there is no time to lose.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 9 - The Darkest Hour","sort":75000},"cf":{"id":"temp_n709dapcyhd","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 9 - The Darkest Hour","color":"#5e2522"}}}
{"_id":"yGSJ2IuAR8AheR9Q","name":"Options: A Different Adolphus","content":"<p>Veteran Players will doubtless be expecting Adolphus the bounty hunter to be exactly as written — which offers you a perfect opportunity to surprise and confuse such presumptious folk by giving Adolphus a completely different set of motivations. Here are three such suggestions, but feel free to expand upon these as you prefer.</p>\n<h3>Gathering Intelligence</h3>\n<p>Instead of killing or capturing ‘Kastor Lieberung’ at the earliest opportunity, Adolphus is playing a longer game. By following the supposed magister impedimentae and watching who he meets, the bounty hunter may be able to identify dozens of Purple Hand cultists, allowing him to report back to his employer the full extent of the Chaos cult’s influence.</p>\n<p>Therefore, after identifying the double in Altdorf, Adolphus simply watches and waits. He is not afraid of losing the magister’s trail, because Adolphus knows he will head toward Bögenhafen; along the way, Adolphus takes the opportunity to kill any cultists he sees interacting with the double Character.</p>\n<p>Sooner or later, Adolphus realises the double Character is not the true magister impedimentae: the confused looks with which they meet cult signs and other attempts at communication make this obvious. Even so, the double can still be useful as bait. As the cultists increase their efforts to make contact with the magister and find out what is going on — and, ultimately, decide that he has gone rogue and try to kill him — the cult exposes more and more of its members.</p>\n<p>Adolphus tries to keep the double Character alive as long as possible without tipping his own hand, firing bolts from the shadows and arranging diversions and traps that lead cultists away from the party at crucial moments. In the end, though, he cares only that the double Character is useful.</p>\n<h3>A Trail of Bodies</h3>\n<p>Adolphus leaves dead Purple Hand cultists in his wake wherever he goes — which is to say, wherever the double Character goes. Soon, the cult leadership concludes that the magister has gone rogue and has started killing his former allies, and it responds by hiring assassins to stop him.</p>\n<p>Adolphus is deliberately stirring up distrust in order to destabilise the cult’s power structure and weaken it from within. He does not care for the double beyond the fact that the Character draws even more cultists into the open, each less friendly than the last. Soon, these are more senior cult members rather than low-ranking messengers, so the double’s usefulness increases — but so does the difficulty of keeping the Character alive.</p>\n<h3>Innocent Souls</h3>\n<p>To reverse Adolphus’s role completely, the bounty hunter is a true champion of truth and justice, which is one of the reasons he was hired in the first place: he is less likely to become corrupted as he hunts the Purple Hand. Already troubled by the deception he practised in order to lead the magister to Bögenhafen, he is horrified when he finally learns the real cultist is dead. He is disgusted by the fact that an innocent soul — greedy, perhaps; less than honest, certainly; but still fundamentally innocent — is the target of increasingly aggressive Purple Hand agents on account of his own ruse. Bound by a sense of shame or a code of secrecy, he vows never to reveal himself or the truth to the hapless Characters, but to follow, observe, and protect without giving himself away. Eventually, depending upon how the Characters resolve the troubles in Bögenhafen, he may step from the shadows to suggest an alliance. Otherwise, Adolphus only reveals his true nature if the Characters manage to capture or corner him.</p>\n<h3>The Ubersreik Connection</h3>\n<p>Adolphus is working for Lady @Actor[hcAF95tFaOdoZoeF]{Emmanuelle Nacht}, the current de facto ruler of Ubersreik, and a woman with reasons to hate the Purple Hand. Instead of seeking to kill Kastor Lieberung, Adolphus has been charged to capture the magister impedimentae and bring him to Ubersreik to face Nacht.</p>\n<p>If you choose to do this, have Adolphus trail the Characters everywhere they go, a constant shadow to their every deed. Instead of personally ambushing the Characters in @JournalEntry[3eKYpGCvUVuC8YFQ]{Weissbruck}, he sends his thugs to do it. He also gives them explicit instructions not to harm the double Character. Adolphus plans to whittle down the magister impedimentae’s allies before making his move. Similarly, Adolphus won’t personally attack the Characters in @JournalEntry[Bögenhafen]{Bögenhafen}. Instead, he again sends minions to do this on his behalf, also with the intent of weakening what he believes are the magister impedimentae’s allies.</p>\n<p>Adolphus makes his real move after the conclusion of <em>Shadows Over Bögenhafen</em>. He plans to capture Lieberung and any of his remaining allies, then drag them to Ubersreik to face his employer.</p>\n<p>Assuming he’s successful, Nacht will quickly uncover the truth if the Characters are open, which potentially secures a powerful ally for the future. Even better, now the Characters are in Ubersreik,  you have the opportunity to play through parts of the <strong>WFRP Starter Set</strong>, or some of the Ubersreik Adventures, before heading off to start <strong>Death on the Reik.</strong></p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-eis/assets/other/grognard2.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 3 - Heart of the Empire","sort":575001},"cf":{"id":"temp_3x0rt108klt","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 3 - Heart of the Empire","color":"#24592b"}}}

{"_id":"ztrsmrosJnXOaWVn","name":"The Appointed Time","content":"<p>This section details the course of events at @Scene[clYfG9LmEw1J5Kmo]{Warehouse 13}. These events only happen if the Characters do not intervene. Any actions they take will alter the course of events to a greater or lesser degree, so you should be prepared to adapt and improvise. You should also take into account what the Characters can see from wherever they are. Be careful to tell the Players only what their Characters can be expected to see.</p>\n<h3>Preparations</h3>\n<p>Shortly after dusk, a cart arrives from the Steinhäger offices bringing @Actor[Coxv92EfL6VmlpCS]{Franz Steinhäger} and two labourers. It draws up outside Warehouse 13, and the three men unload a number of sacks containing the items removed from the Hidden Temple. The cart is driven away, leaving Steinhäger inside. He begins to prepare the temple, laying out the copper circle, marking an octagram on the floor in salt and placing the silver candlesticks at the corners.</p>\n<p>After about half an hour, five carriages arrive within a quarter of an hour of each other. @Actor[LG5qATEIFPE9bezB]{Teugen} and @Actor[IvvkdVTJzutEsrlX]{Gideon} (wearing the face of ‘Teugen’s cousin’ again, so the Characters are unlikely to recognise it) get out of one carriage, which has the Teugen family’s rose-symbol on the doors. The passengers go into the warehouse, each carrying a small bundle (their robes), and the coaches drive back into the town. This is the Inner Council of the Ordo Septenarius. It has arrived for the ritual and spends the next half an hour robing and making other preparations. While this is going on, a dozen @Actor[JOvvyUSDLR5XkN9R]{thugs} from the Stevedores’ Guild unobtrusively ring the warehouse to make sure that those inside are not disturbed. </p>\n<p>This is not immediately obvious in the green-tinged fog, and requires a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test from outside the warehouse to spot it. At this point, Characters hiding outside the warehouse must make another <strong>Easy (+40) Stealth (Urban)</strong>, modified as you feel is appropriate for where the Characters are hiding. The thugs clear the area of anyone they find.</p>\n<h3>The Dedication</h3>\n<p>Another half hour or so passes, and a cart arrives from the north of the town, coming out on to the Ostendamm between Warehouse 17 and the @JournalEntry[6zK35chsJmYi4WYz]{Teamsters' Guild}. It pulls up outside Warehouse 13, and two men, thugs from the @JournalEntry[KoTTFOzxJmVi6EPe]{Stevedores' Guild}, unload a large, heavy sack and carry it into the warehouse.</p>\n<p>The sack contains a young woman who has been ‘acquired’ for the sacrifice. Her blood will consecrate the warehouse for use as a temple. Any Characters outside the warehouse who make a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test see the sack move as the semi-conscious woman struggles weakly. Having delivered the victim, the two men drive off, returning the way they came.</p>\n<p>The victim is bound hand and foot and is laid in the middle of the octagram. The participants are now dressed in red robes with a seven-pointed star surrounding an animal head emblazoned on the chest. They wear tall, pointed head-dresses that hide their faces completely. They stand in a circle around the woman, chanting rhythmically as @Actor[LG5qATEIFPE9bezB]{Teugen} draws a dagger. He passes the blade ceremoniously through the flames of the eight candles, and then stands over the woman, with the dagger raised high above his head. The chanting comes to an abrupt halt, and Teugen plunges the dagger into the woman’s chest. He then cuts her heart out, and sprinkles blood from it on the eight corners of the octagram, and on the points where any lines cross. Her heart is placed at the centre of the circle, and two of the cultists carry her body to one side, being careful not to disturb the octagram.</p>\n<p>If this sacrifice is thwarted in any way, Teugen tries to capture one of the Characters to take the woman’s place or, failing this, he calls in one of the thugs from outside, who will be overpowered by the cultists and sacrificed.</p>\n<p>Once the sacrifice has taken place, the makeshift temple is ready for use, and the ritual begins.</p>\n<h3>The Ritual</h3>\n<p>The ritual begins two hours before midnight. The seven members of the Inner Council (including one who has been drafted in from the lower echelons of the Ordo Septenarius as a replacement for Magirius) each stand at a point of the octagram around the copper circle, with Teugen in the middle, and Gideon taking up the last spot.</p>\n<p>The cultists raise a discordant chant. This continues, unless they are disturbed, throughout the ritual. Teugen stands with one foot on either side of the heart of the sacrificed woman, chanting in a counterpoint to the other cultists. There are several invocations and responses, and each cultist in turn then moves to the centre, kisses the first two fingers of their right hand, and touches them to the heart briefly, returning to the circle as the next cultist moves forward. The chant is maintained unbroken throughout.</p>\n<p>After an hour and a half, Teugen then plucks a scroll free from his belt. He unrolls it, and the chant stops as he carefully reads it in a singsong voice. Neither the chant nor the words from the scroll are intelligible to a Character without the Language (Magick) Skill. A successful <strong>Impossible (−50) Language (Magick)</strong> Test reveals that there is a subtle undercurrent to the spell, cleverly hidden, that beseeches ‘Tchar’ to rip reality asunder ‘from the Crystal Labyrinth’, to ‘reign in the Mortal Realm’. </p>\n<p>@Actor[LG5qATEIFPE9bezB]{Teugen} has not noticed this. It takes Teugen about half an hour to read the scroll. He pauses at several points to sketch mystical figures in the air with his hands, and the other participants chant responses to his invocations at various times. After about 20 minutes of this, @Actor[IvvkdVTJzutEsrlX]{Gideon} enters the octagram. He takes the @Item[c3T3NCS9SPDdEQyy]{Ring of Opsianon} from its finger and gives it to Teugen, before taking up a position behind him. <strong>Note</strong>: once Gideon takes the ring off, it becomes subject to if he moves outside the circle. Teugen, still chanting, passes the ring through the flames of the candle at each corner of the octagram, and then returns to the centre, where he kisses the ring and places it on top of the heart. The cultists come into the centre one by one, and kiss the ring in turn as Teugen continues  to chant.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the tone of Teugen’s chanting changes. The cultists stand absolutely still in an attitude of rapt attention, and Gideon remains motionless behind Teugen. The ritual is nearing completion.</p>\n<h3>Foiling the Ritual</h3>\n<p>If not interrupted, the ritual finishes a few minutes before midnight. There are several ways the Characters can prevent this.</p>\n<h4>Attacking the Participants </h4>\n<p>If the Characters are inside the warehouse already, they can attack at any time. Otherwise, they must fight their way in through the thugs stationed outside. The thugs are all round the warehouse, so the Characters encounter two thugs no matter which direction they approach from. Each Round after a fight breaks out, another thug arrives, until all 12 are on the scene. Every time that one of the thugs is killed or incapacitated, you should make a Cool Test for the others. Start the Difficulty at <strong>Very Easy (+60)</strong>, and make it 1 step more difficult for every two thugs taken down. If any Test is failed, the remaining thugs flee.</p>\n<p>Once the thugs are dealt with, the Characters are free to advance. They can storm into the warehouse through the front doors, or they can rip the thin wooden slats off the windows and fire missiles at the participants. The slats are backed with stout iron grilles that make it impossible to climb in through the windows, but it is possible to throw or fire missiles through the grilles with a penalty of −10 to any associated Ranged Test.</p>\n<p>When the Characters attack, Teugen instructs the seven members of the Inner Council to stand back and avert their eyes. He casts @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.Rkg1tMICxdRsH1zB]{Bolt (Daemonology)} at any Characters who are Elves or who appear to be spellcasters. Gideon casts @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.xhGjRScyU149nK3i]{Treason of Tzeentch}. There is a 30% chance they cast their spells at the same Character.</p>\n<p>Next, Gideon tears free of its Human disguise and appears in daemonic form, giving it Fear 2 against everyone except Teugen. Each cultist must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Cool</strong> Test. Those who fail have disobeyed Teugen’s instructions to look away, and must Test to resist the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.pTorrE0l3VybAbtn]{Fear 2}.</p>\n<p>Gideon next casts a Spell at any Characters who are still advancing, before closing for hand-to-hand combat. Gideon fights until the Characters are wiped out or beaten off, or until it is killed. Meanwhile, Teugen tries to rally the other cultists, using his Leadership Skill away from the scene of combat. Whenever the Characters seem to be gaining the upper hand, you should give the remaining cultists an Opposed Cool Test against Teugen’s Leadership Skill. Any cultist who fails the  Test flees.</p>\n<p>Stealing or Destroying Vital Components</p>\n<p>The following are vital to the ritual taking place.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>@Actor[LG5qATEIFPE9bezB]{Teugen}</li>\n<li>The seven members of the Inner Council</li>\n<li>The spell scroll, which Teugen carries on his belt</li>\n<li>The @Item[c3T3NCS9SPDdEQyy]{Ring of Opsianon}</li>\n<li>The Ordo’s copper circle, or any piece of it</li>\n<li>Eight silver candlesticks holding black candles</li>\n<li>An octagram marked on the floor of a sanctified temple with salt<br /><br /><br /></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If the Characters are able to steal or destroy any of these things, the ritual fails. This includes extinguishing the candles or stopping the sanctification of the new temple by rescuing the woman. If the Characters took the silver candlesticks from the Hidden Temple earlier in the adventure, they have been replaced. A replacement has also been drafted in for Magirius, and if any other member of the Inner Council has been killed or severely injured earlier in the adventure, a similar replacement is swiftly arranged to bring the numbers up to the needed seven.</p>\n<h4>Delaying the Ritual</h4>\n<p>Once started, the ritual must be completed before midnight, so any delay of more than 10 Turns is fatal. Teugen still tries to conduct the ritual, but midnight strikes before it is completed.</p>\n<h4>Other Means</h4>\n<p>The Characters may try to disrupt the ritual by other means, such as setting fire to the warehouse. It is not possible to cover every contingency here, but you should be able to tell, using common sense and the information in this chapter, what the outcome of a particular attempt is.</p>\n<h3>The Ritual Disrupted</h3>\n<p>As soon as it becomes apparent that the ritual cannot be completed for any reason, Teugen breaks down completely, and runs screaming and raving into the night. When the bell in the temple of Sigmar strikes midnight, a cloud of thick, foul-smelling pink and blue smoke gathers around him. There is a shattering scream, and when the smoke clears, as abruptly as it appeared, there is no trace of him. Every Character  who witnesses this must make a <strong>Difficult (−10) Cool</strong> Test to resist @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.kJNAY1YRaCy9IgmT]{Terror 2}.</p>\n<p>If midnight strikes and the ritual is still in progress, everything comes to an abrupt halt as the bell is heard tolling the hour. Tongues of roiling pink and blue fire lick from the octagram. From its depths, an enormous unblinking Eye, fringed with scintillating feathers, coiled through with every conceivable colour, forms. </p>\n<p>Any witnesses must make a <strong>Hard (−20) Cool </strong>Test to resist @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.kJNAY1YRaCy9IgmT]{Terror 3}. Teugen screams and begs for more time, but a disembodied, many-toned voice sounds — more in people’s minds than in the air — deep and high, terrible and mellifluous, and so very cold.</p>\n<p><em>‘I claim your soul. It was always mine; but you were more useful when you believed you could save it. Now you are needed for other matters.’ </em></p>\n<p>Teugen screams as he bursts into multicoloured fire. The cultists, appalled, scatter, tripping over themselves, terrified beyond rational thought. As this happens, Gideon desperately snatches up the scroll and begins to read from it, taking up where Teugen left off. For the first time, its voice is strained, and it stumbles over phrases as it rushes to complete the invocation. When Teugen has burned away, the giant burning eye turns to Gideon. The disembodied voice sounds again.</p>\n<p>‘<em>There is no portal. You have failed. Return to me</em>.’ </p>\n<p>Gideon is then forced to his daemonic form (if it has not changed already) and begins to burn in coruscating flames. It howls and writhes in unspeakable agony, then burns away. Every Character who witnesses this must make a <strong>Difficult (−10) Cool</strong> Test to resist @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.kJNAY1YRaCy9IgmT]{Terror 2}. The great Eye in the octogram then looks to the Character that appears like Kastor Lieberung (if still alive — if not, choose a different Character). The Eye pauses. The Character is frozen in place. Then the eye burns away.</p>\n<p>Any Character within 99 yards of the Eye must Test for a @Corruption[major]{Major Exposure to Corruption.}</p>\n<h3>The Ritual Completed</h3>\n<p>If the Characters fail in their attempts to stop the ritual, or do not attempt to do so, you have two options: either you fudge things so that the ritual is halted anyway, or you have the gate open.</p>\n<p>If you feel the Characters were only prevented from stopping the ritual by bad luck or force of circumstances, you may decide to have circumstance work in their favour, so that the final completion of the ritual is prevented by a chance event. For example, a rat scurries across the warehouse floor and breaks the salt pentagram, or one of the participants panics at the last minute and runs screaming into the night. However, this may prove to be something of an anticlimax, especially if the Characters conclude that everything would have turned out for the best regardless of their actions. So, you may well decide that the worst should happen, even if the Characters deserve better.</p>\n<p>If, on the other hand, the Characters had ample opportunity to stop the ritual but failed to do so, you should not shrink from inflicting the full consequences. The Greater Daemon of Tzeentch responsible for the events in Bögenhafen exults as a Chaos Gate opens in the Empire. Bögenhafen is doomed, and the Characters must run for their lives. </p>\n<p>This option is extremely dangerous and could lead to the entire party being wiped out if the Characters do not move swiftly enough, but it also provides an exciting climax to the adventure.</p>\n<h4>Apocalypse</h4>\n<p>If the ritual is completed before midnight, a gate to Tzeentch’s Crystal Labyrinth in the Realms of Chaos yawns open. The area within the copper circle suddenly falls inwards, and Teugen and the members of the Inner Council tumble into the pit, their screams an eternal reminder of their foolishness as they fall into infinity. Gideon resumes its Daemon form (if it has not done so already) and jumps into the pit with a delighted squeal. Any Character witnessing the opening of the pit must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Cool</strong> Test to resist @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.kJNAY1YRaCy9IgmT]{Terror 2}.</p>\n<p>For a few minutes, everything is still. The inside of the pit is totally black: not even the sides can be seen. Any Character who looks into the pit will see a pulsating multicoloured light in the distance, drawing rapidly closer. With alarming speed, a boiling mass of primal Chaos speeds towards the new Chaos Gate.</p>\n<p>Any Character who sees it coming must make a <strong>Very Hard (−30) Cool</strong> Test to resist @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.kJNAY1YRaCy9IgmT]{Terror 4}. A cacophony of howls, bellows and ear-splitting shrieks erupts from the pit — until it is almost unbearable. A roaring fountain of pink fire follows, shattering the roof of the warehouse and pouring high into the night sky over the town. Falling droplets of fire hit the ground smoking and sizzling. Anywhere a droplet lands a twisted, unnatural Daemon forms. </p>\n<p>The pit slowly widens, expanding some 10ft per minute until it occupies the whole site of the town. The pit swallows people, animals, and buildings, and the stream of pink fire spews into the sky unabated.</p>\n<p>Slowly, a great, winged shape wreathed in blue fire takes form atop the pink fountain of Chaos — it has impossibly long arms and two scintillating, avian heads, both of which scream with a chorus of uncounted millions of damned souls. This is the chosen form of an exultant Greater Daemon sent by the Chaos God Tzeentch as it manifests in the Mortal Realm. Its arms, each blistered with burnt-yellow eyes, reach down again and again to the streets, scooping up handfuls of fleeing people and shoveling them into its hungry, gaping maws. </p>\n<p>This is, obviously, terrifying. All Characters must make an <strong>Impossible (−50) Cool</strong> Test to resist @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.kJNAY1YRaCy9IgmT]{Terror 5}.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Daemons run gibbering through the streets, harrying the streams of refugees like wild dogs chasing a herd of sheep. The stragglers and the hindmost are brought down and torn limb from limb in an orgy of feeding.</p>\n<p>If the Characters are to have any chance of surviving, they must flee. Immediately. If they do leave quickly, they may be able to get clear of the town before the pit swallows everyone, and the sky fills with shoals of screaming Daemons. You should play out the party’s flight in full, keeping careful track of its position on the town map. Once the pink fire erupts, roll [[/r 1d10 + 5]] Wounds, modified by Toughness Bonus and APs as normal. If a 9 is rolled, the Character also gains 1 Corruption point.</p>\n<p><br />While you shouldn’t make it easy for the Characters, bear in mind that they ought to be able to escape provided that they don’t do anything too foolish, and you should avoid wiping out the party. However, having them spend some Fate points and Resilience points is not only appropriate, it’s likely to be inevitable.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-eis/assets/set-pictures/ritual.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"W7hDmaVDe1iLHHWX":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-eis":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 9 - The Darkest Hour","sort":93750},"cf":{"id":"temp_n709dapcyhd","path":"Enemy In Shadows#/CF_SEP/Chapter 9 - The Darkest Hour","color":"#5e2522"}}}
